This involves classifying the characteristics of natural capital and \nthe environmental functions to which it gives rise, and then defining standards of environmental \nsustainability for these functions. The framework then relates these functions to the economic \nsystem, through the input/output tables, in order to identify the pressures on the functions and \nhence the extent to which the functions are not being maintained at a sustainable level. The \nframework is worked though in some detail for water, with less detailed application of it to air, \nland and habitats. The methodology can be used to identify areas of environmental \nunsustainability and the processes to which this unsustainability is due, so that policies to more \ntowards sustainability may be more easily identified. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1\n1  THEORETICAL CONSIDERATIONS \n \n1.1 INTRODUCTION \n \nIn Ekins et al., this issue, environmental sustainability was defined as the maintenance of \nimportant environmental functions, and hence the maintenance of the capacity of the capital stock \nto provide those functions. In other words the emphasis in this conception of environmental \nsustainability is on the capacity of the natural capital stock to perform important environmental \nfunctions, rather than on particular components of the stock themselves. This reflects a perception \nthat, from a human point of view, what matters about the environment is not particular stocks of \nnatural capital per se, but the ability of the capital stock as a whole to be able to continue to \nperform the environmental functions which make an important contribution to human welfare. \n \nClearly there is a close relationship between the capacity of natural capital to perform certain \nenvironmental functions and the particular components of the capital stock. But the relationship is \ncomplex, and is not one-to-one. It certainly cannot be assumed that certain environmental \nfunctions are uniquely performed by particular stocks of natural capital; and a particular \ncomponent of natural capital may be involved in performing several, perhaps very different, \nenvironmental functions. Moreover, the environmental function may derive more from a natural \nprocess (for example, the carbon or water cycle) than any particular component of natural capital \nper se, and many different components may play a part in such processes. \n \nWhile it may, therefore, be meaningful and useful to think of Critical Natural Capital (CNC) as \nthat part of the natural capital stock which performs those environmental functions the \nmaintenance of which is required for environmental sustainability, it is not possible to make a \ncomprehensive inventory of CNC in these terms. In some cases it will be possible to identify \nparticular components of natural capital as ‘critical’. Obvious examples are rare species or \necosystems which are important for biodiversity and irreplaceable if lost. But generally CNC can \nonly be identified in respect of particular characteristics of parts of the natural capital stock, \nwhich enable it, in combination with other characteristics of the same, or different, parts of the \nnatural capital stock, to perform the environmental functions which are of concern. It is \naccordingly with an inventory of the characteristics of the natural capital stock that any attempt to \nclassify, or make an inventory, of CNC must start. \n \n \n1.2 DESCRIPTION OF NATURAL CAPITAL AND ITS CHARACTERISTICS \n \nThere are four basic types or categories of natural capital: air, water (fresh and marine), land \n(comprising the characteristics of soil, space and landscape) and habitats (including the \necosystems, flora and fauna which they both comprise and support)1. \n \nThe four categories of natural capital have certain environmental characteristics, of which de \nGroot lists 53 (de Groot 1992, Table I.0-1, p.274), classified in nine groups as follows: \n                                                          \n1 There are different classifications of habitats, and different lists of habitats are appropriate for different countries. \nAnnex 1 gives de Groot’s classification for the world as a whole. In the UK, the UK Biodiversity Action Plan \ndescribes the main UK habitats as woodlands, grasslands, lowland heaths, uplands, wetlands (including bogs and \nfens), freshwater habitats (lakes and ponds, rivers and streams, canals and grazing marsh ditches), coastal areas (cliffs, \nestuaries, saltmarshes, sand dunes and shingle shorelines), marine habitats, and urban areas (UKG 1994, pp.31ff.), to \nwhich may be added peatlands, moorland and farmland. \n 2\n \n1. Bedrock characteristics and geological processes \n2. Atmospheric properties and climatological processes \n3. Geomorphological processes and properties \n4. Hydrological processes and properties (at the surface) \n5. Soil processes and properties \n6. Vegetation characteristics \n7. Characteristics of the flora and fauna (species characteristics) \n8. Life-community properties and food chain interactions \n9. Ecosystem parameters \n \nThese characteristics, and their more detailed sub-characteristics (with de Groot’s original order \nand wording slightly altered to suit the present purposes), can in fact be associated with one of the \nfour basic types of natural capital, set out in Annex 2. \n \nIn addition to the characteristics of natural capital, there are characteristics of human-made capital \n(or mixed human-made and natural capital), which perform important environmental functions \n(for example, buildings or cultivated landscapes). These environmental functions, and the \ncharacteristics and capital from which they derive, may be important for the social and economic \ndimensions of sustainability, and may therefore be identified as critical capital. However, such \ncapital is only considered in this paper where natural capital (including cultivated natural capital) \nis its principal component. \n \n \n1.3 DESCRIPTION OF ENVIRONMENTAL FUNCTIONS \n \nIt is the characteristics of the natural capital set out in Annex 2 which constitute its capacity to \nperform environmental functions, which may be defined as the provision by natural capital’s \nprocesses and components of goods and services that satisfy human needs (directly and/or \nindirectly). The ‘goods’ (e.g. resources) are usually provided by the components (plants, animals, \nminerals, ecosystems etc.); the ‘services’ (e.g. waste recycling) by the processes (biogeochemical \ncycling). \n \nDe Groot et al. (2000) have classified environmental functions into Regulation, Production, \nHabitat and Information functions (see also Ekins et al., this issue, and Chiesura & de Groot, this \nissue). Pearce & Turner (1990, pp.35ff.) have grouped environmental functions into Source, Sink \nand Service functions. Noel & O’Connor (1998, p.83) have divided the last of these categories of \nScenery, Site and Life Support functions. \n \nIn line with the CRITINC Framework derived by Ekins et al., (this issue), environmental functions \nmay be principally identified with one of the four basic types of natural capital, and divided into \nSource (So), Sink (Si), Life Support (LS) and Human Health and Welfare (HW) Functions, \nfollowing the classification in Figure 6.1 in Ekins et al. (this issue). The environmental functions \nlisted in de Groot 1992 (p.15), to which a few have been added, can then be grouped as in Annex \n3. \n \nSource functions refer to the provision of goods for human use and benefit, very often through the \neconomy. Sink functions refer to the capacities of natural capital to dispose of the wastes \ngenerated by human activities. Human Health and Welfare (HW) functions refer to other services \n 3\nprovided to humans by natural capital, very often of a non-economic kind, which maintain health \nand contribute to human well-being in a variety of ways. Source, Sink and HW functions all \ntherefore provide goods and services directly for humans. \n \nLife Support (LS) functions, in contrast, relate to the natural processes which maintain both \necosystems and the biosphere as a whole. These are the functions of and for the natural world \noverall, as opposed to functions specifically for people. Clearly these functions are of the utmost \nimportance to humanity, because it is these functions which, in sum, make the Earth (uniquely \namong planets as far as science is so far aware) able to support life, including human life. Many of \nthe Source, Sink and HW functions depend on the LS functions for their continuance. The LS \nfunctions are therefore the primary functions of the natural world, which establish the basic \nconditions for the other categories of functions to provide their benefits for people. \n \nIt must be stressed that although the functions have been allocated to one type of natural capital, in \nmany cases they are actually the result of interactions between more than one type. Some of the \nmore important examples of such interactions will be identified in the descriptions of functions, \nand their relation to natural capital, which follow. However, it can be said of relatively few of the \nfunctions that they are exclusively related to a single type of natural capital, and this should be \nborne in mind as impacts on the types of natural capital are being considered. Most obviously, \nactivities which destroy or disrupt ecosystems may also affect functions which have been \nattributed to air/atmosphere, water or land, because of the continuous interactions and feedbacks \nbetween ecosystems and other types of natural capital. \n \n \n1.4 DEFINING STANDARDS OF ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY \n \nWith environmental sustainability defined as the maintenance of important environmental \nfunctions, Ekins et al. 1999 enumerated seven sustainability principles to give guidance as to \nwhich environmental functions should be maintained at what levels. The principles were derived \nfrom consideration of current environmental problems (symptoms of unsustainability) and insights \nfrom environmental science into the functioning of natural systems and their importance for \nhuman health and welfare. \n \nEkins et al. (this issue, Table 5.2)also listed the environmental themes and indicators which an \nexpert survey had judged to be the most important. The themes may be grouped according to the \ntypes of natural capital as in Table 1.1. \n \n \nAIR/ Air pollution, resulting in   \nATMOSPHERE Climate change, Ozone depletion and \n Effects on ecosystems and human health \n \nWATER Availability of water resources \n Water pollution \n \nLAND Loss of soil fertility/land degradation \n(inc. soil/space/landscape) Depletion of non-renewable resources \n Land pollution/solid waste disposal \n Landscape degradation \n 4\n \nHABITATS Habitat and species loss \n Depletion of renewable resources (fish, forests) \n \n \nTable 1.1: Principal Environmental Themes Identified by Expert Survey, (EUROSTAT 1998), \ngrouped by type of natural capital \n \n \nIt is an easy matter to identify which of the environmental functions of Annex 3 are threatened by \nthe environmental themes listed in Table 1. The threatened functions can in turn be related to the \nenvironmental characteristics, and thence to the components of natural capital, from which they \nderive. If the function is important for environmental sustainability, the natural capital thus \nidentified may be identified as Critical Natural Capital in respect of that environmental function. It \nis in this sense that an inventory of CNC may be drawn up. The information for each of the main \nenvironmental media (Air, Water, Land/Soil and Habitats) may be ordered for ease of reference \nwithin the Critical Natural Capital (CRITINC) Framework presented in Ekins et al. (this issue). \nThe next section illustrates the application of the Framework in some detail to Water, and the \nfollowing section shows more generally how it may be applied to the other media. \n \n \n2 APPLYING THE CRITINC FRAMEWORK TO WATER \n \nFigure 2.1 (at end of paper) shows the Critical Natural Capital Framework for Water. In Level 1 \nare the Natural Characteristics for Water, taken from Annex 2. These characteristics give rise to \nthe environmental functions (grouped as Source, Sink, Life Support and Human Health and \nWelfare functions) performed by water, which are given in Level 2 and are taken from Annex 3. \nThus, for example, the characteristic ‘Interactions with atmosphere’ (2.4. in Level 1) influences \nthe amount of precipitation observed. This, in turn, affects the overall reservoir stock (2.1. in \nLevel 1). Precipitation also affects other parameters, such as the flow of rivers.  \n \nThe stock and flow of water directly determine whether the various environmental functions can \nbe provided or not. In particular, they constitute the main ‘limiting factor’ of water’s Source \nfunctions, which are: \n \n2.1So Water catchment and groundwater recharge \n2.2So Water (for drinking, irrigation, industry etc.) \n2.3So Medium for transport \n \nWater stocks and flows also play a major and direct role in relation to the other environmental \nfunctions, which are: \n \nSink functions \n2.4Si Regulation of the chemical composition of the oceans \n2.5Si Dispersion and dilution of emissions to water \n \nLife Support functions \n2.6LS Fulfilment of habitat water requirements (quantity and quality) \n2.7LS Regulation of runoff and flood protection (watershed protection) \n 5\n \nHuman Health and Welfare functions \n2.8HW Purification of water for human consumption \n2.9HW Provision and purification of water for recreation \n2.10-2.13HW Aesthetic, spiritual and religious, historic, and scientific and educational \ninformation, and cultural and artistic inspiration \n \nIn the case of the Sink functions, the quantity and flow of water affects its capacity to abate \npollution through dilution (2.5Si). With regard to the Life Support functions the water habitat \n(2.6LS) is dependent on water quantity and flow. Finally, the functions related to human health \nand welfare are also affected by water stocks and flows in that the quantity of water available for \nhuman consumption is critical for human health (2.8HW). Water levels also affect the enjoyment \nand recreation possibilities of a river (2.9-2.13HW). These interactions are shown figuratively in \nFigure 2.2. \n \n \nInteractions with atmosphere \nPrecipitation \nReservoir stocks and flows \ndirect effects on: \n \n \nSource  \nFunctions \nSink  \nfunctions \nLife Support  \nfunctions \nHuman Health and \nWelfare functions \nQuantity of water \n(irrigation, transport, \ncatchment recharge) \nDilution Habitats Quantity, quality \nand appearance of \nwater \n  \nFigure 2.2: The Effects of the Characteristic ‘Interactions with Atmosphere’ on the \nEnvironmental Functions of Water \n \n \nThe functions performed by the Natural Characteristics of water may be affected by economic \nactivities. Possible interferences with the production functions include over-abstraction of water, \nrunoff from impermeable surfaces, and alteration of the water flow. Over-abstraction may affect \nthe ability of water ecosystems to dilute pollution and to support fish and other water-based foods \nand sea creatures, i.e. affect the Sink and Life Support functions, as well as the Source functions. \nIn turn, if the habitat is altered, the production of species from these habitats can be reduced, a \nfunction which is listed in Annex 3 as a function of Habitats, but which is also clearly dependent \non the adequate availability of water resources. Similarly, the effects of economic activities on the \nproduction functions of water also affect its human health and welfare functions. \n  \nThese kinds of effects can be described in more detail with reference to the economic input-output \ntables, in Level 2 on the left of Figure 2.1, which enable the impacts of economic activities on \nenvironmental functions to be ascribed to the relevant economic sectors. Various sectors affect the \nSource functions, and therefore the other functions, of water through over-abstraction. In the UK \nabout a third of water abstractions are related to the public and private water supply, with the rest \nbeing divided between power generation, industry and agriculture. Over-abstraction is having a \nsignificant effect on UK ecosystems, the most obvious effect being the drying out of water \n 6\nhabitats. Thus, English Nature has identified a number of cases of river Sites of Special Scientific \nInterest (SSSIs) affected by over-abstractions aimed at meeting the needs of public and private \ndemand for water. Impacts of water depletion on the Source functions of water are listed in Impact \nMatrix A. Impacts of water depletion on the other kinds of functions of water are listed in Impact \nMatrices B,C and D. The impacts are represented figuratively in Figure 2.3. \n \n \n Source  \n(Production) \nfunctions \nSink \nfunctions \nLife Support \nfunctions \nHuman Health \nand Welfare \nfunctions \nInput-output \ntable: \neconomic \nactivities. \nAgriculture \nIndustry \nPublic and \nprivate water \nsupply, etc. \n \n \n \n \n \nMatrix A \nABSTRACTIONS \nMatrix B \nProblems of    \ndilution of \npollution \n \n \n \nMatrix C \nChange in \nhabitats \n \n \n \n \nMatrix D \nLack of \navailability and  \nproblems of \nquality \n  \nFigure 2.3: The Impacts of Abstractions on the Environmental Functions of Water \n \n \nThe economic activities represented by the Input/Output Tables also produce emissions to water, \nwhich appear in the box below the I/O Tables on the left of Figure 2.1. These emissions feed \nacross the Figure to affect water’s environmental functions. For example, the agricultural sector \ncontributes to UK eutrophication by discharging pollutants such as nitrates (between 165000 and \n500000 tonnes in 1994) and phosphates (between 15000 and 25000 tonnes in 1994) into the water \nenvironment. It also pollutes water by contaminating it with pesticides (19 tonnes of mecoprop, \nand 17 tonnes of isoproturon discharged in water in 1994, for instance). Similarly, the energy \nsector pollutes the water environment with heavy metals (400 tonnes of zinc and 100 tonne of \ncopper in 1994, for instance), while the industrial sector emitted 200 tonnes of lead into water in \n1994 (Vaze, 1998). The pollution of water affects its Source functions, especially the provision of \ndrinking water and water-based foods. These impacts are listed in Impact Matrix A’. It also affects \nthe Sink functions, most obviously the ability of water to disperse and dilute emissions. These \nimpacts are listed in Impact Matrix B’. This leads to concentrations of water pollutants which \nhave unsustainable impacts on water’s Life Support functions. These impacts appear in Impact \nMatrix C’. The combination of the impacts matrices C and C’ may result in elevated \nconcentrations emitted to water that might lead, in turn, to unsustainable impacts on ecosystem \nhealth (Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution, 1992). \n  \nThe elevated concentrations of pollutants in water may also damage water’s Human Health and \nWelfare functions. It is now very clear that a series of health problems are directly created by \nwater pollution. The impacts of water pollution on these functions are listed in the Impact Matrix \nD’. Figure 2.4 shows figuratively how water pollution from economic activities can directly affect \nthe different kinds of environmental function. The weakened Sink functions that are the results \nhave a further indirect effect on the other kinds of function. \n \n \n 7\n Source  \n(Production) \nfunctions \nSink functions Life Support \nfunctions \nHuman Health \nand welfare \nfunctions \nWater \npollution \nemissions by \nsector \nDirectly affect \n \nAgriculture \n \n \nEnergy sector \nIndustrial sec. \nDomestic sec. \nMatrix A' Matrix B' \n \n \n \n \nNitrates \nPhosphates \nPesticides \n \nHeavy metals \nLead \nChemicals \nMatrix C' Matrix D' \n Matrix A' weakened \nSink functions \nIndirectly \naffect \nMatrix C' Matrix D' \n \nFigure 2.4: The Impacts of Water Pollution on the Environmental Functions of Water \n \n \nSustainability standards may be applied to each of the types of affected environmental functions, \nas shown in Level 3 of Figure 2.1. With regard to Human Health and Welfare functions, this may \nbe the level of concentration of the pollutant in water that should not be exceeded if human health \nis to be protected. Such sustainability standards also exist in the case of ecosystem health, and \nmay or may not be the same as for human health. For example, nitrates, in the quantities normally \nfound in food or feed, become toxic under conditions in which they are or become nitrites. Under \nother conditions, at reasonable concentration levels, nitrates are rapidly eliminated through urine. \nThe reaction of nitrites with haemoglobin can be hazardous in infants under 3 months of age. \nThere are also serious risks of poisoning in infants, and potential risk of methemoglobinemia at \nvarious ages. The World Health Organisation (WHO, 1995) has set the standard of 10 mg/l nitrate \nnitrogen (N) for domestic water supplies to safeguard human health. Various ecosystem species \nreact differently. So, for instance, it seems that levels of nitrate nitrogen (N) at or below 90 mg/l \nwould have no adverse effects on warm water fish, and that nitrite nitrogen at or below 5 mg/l \nmight even be protective of most warm fish. In the UK, it has been identified that there is an 0.9% \nexceedance of the drinking water standards in England and Wales, 3.7% exceedance of standards \nfor pesticides in water, and 0.6% exceedance for nitrate standards, amongst samples analysed. \n \nThere are also standards for bathing water, to the effect that at least 95% of samples taken must \nnot exceed the mandatory limit values set down in the European Bathing Waters Directive for \ntotal and faecal coliforms, which is considered to be the most reliable indicator of sewage \ncontamination. In 1996, 90% of UK Bathing Waters were complying with the Directive. \n \nIt is therefore clear that, for water, sustainability standards relating to the concentrations of \npollutants in water, may be derived to protect both human health and ecosystem species health. \nThere also exist some sustainability standards concerning the quantity of water, as English Nature \nhas shown in ‘Water level requirements of selected plants and animals’ (EN, 1997). Generally, \n 8\nthere are also some ‘Minimum acceptable flows’, that would correspond to sustainability \nstandards for the provision of the Source functions of water. Figure 2.5 shows in general terms \nthat, for each of the different kinds of environmental functions, there are sustainability standards \nrelating to both the depletion and pollution of water. \n \n \n Source \n(Production) \nfunctions \nSink functions Life Support \nfunctions \nHuman Health \nand welfare \nfunctions \nInput-output \ntables \nQUANTITIES \n \n * \n \n   * \n \n   * \n \n    * \nWater pollutants \nemissions \nQUALITY \n \n  * \n \n * \n \n * \n \n * \nSustainability \nstandards \n \nMinimum \nrequirements  \nfor catchment \nrecharge \n \n Safe water \n availability \n \nMinimum \nrequirements  \nfor dilution \n \n Other require-\n ments for \n pollution \n abatement \n \nMinimum \nrequirements  \nfor habitats \n \nEcosystem health \nstandards \n \nMinimum \nquantity \nnecessary \n \nHuman health \nand recreation \nstandards \n \nFigure 5: Sustainability Standards for Depletion and Pollution for the Different \nEnvironmental Functions of Water \n \n \nThe distance between current concentrations and emissions for a given pollutant, and those \nidentified as environmentally sustainable, is termed the physical ‘sustainability gap’ for that \npollutant. The monetary sustainability gap (M-SGAP) may be derived from this by calculating the \ncosts associated with abating or avoiding emissions, or restoring environmental functions, such \nthat the sustainability standards are met. \n \nThis framework permits the identification of sustainability gaps and the prioritisation of the \nconservation actions which may restore the water environment and eliminate effects on human \nhealth. The framework shows which economic activities are primarily responsible for damage to \nthe functions of water, and also which other species or habitats are being affected, which enables a \nset of restoration strategies to be established and implemented in a holistic way. \n \nWater as Critical Natural Capital \n \nCompletion of the Impact Matrices A, A’, B, B’, C, C’, D, D’ and their comparison with the \nsustainability standards of Level 3 in Figure 2.1 would be likely to show that effects from human \nactivities are having a serious impact on the capacity of water to perform its environmental \nfunctions as listed under 2.1-2.14. In some cases, the effects may be reversible (e.g. much water \npollution). Some effects, however, are irreversible, including those from climate change, some \necosystem change as a result of water abstraction or drainage, some effects on human health (most \n 9\nobviously where people die from water pollution, as many do especially in developing countries) \nand some effects on the human cultural heritage (e.g. from the diversion of rivers or flooding due \nto large dams). Perhaps the best known example of unsustainability with regard to water has been \nthe shrinking of the Aral Sea. \n \nEnvironmental sustainability is therefore not being achieved in many instances with regard to \nwater. Water is often not being maintained in its role as Critical Natural Capital. Derivation of the \nSGAPs in Figure 2.1 would allow a quantitative assessment of the extent to which this was the \ncase and, if remedial action was undertaken, would further be able to show when sustainable use \nof water was being achieved. Irreversible changes might mean that the level of the environmental \nfunctions performed by water was different to what it would have been had it not been affected by \nhuman activities in the first place. \n \n \n3 APPLYING THE FRAMEWORK TO OTHER \nENVIRONMENTAL MEDIA \n \n3.1 AIR/ATMOSPHERE \n \nThe only source function of air/atmosphere is the production of gases that are indispensable for \nhuman life (mainly oxygen). Immediately an interaction between the air/atmosphere and habitats \n(ecosystems) may be noted in the performance of this function. This Source function is not \n(currently) threatened by human activities, so that depletion is not an issue.  \n \nThe polluting effects of human economic activities have a strong impact on air and the \natmosphere, and affect its Sink, Life Support and Human Health and Welfare functions (see \nAnnex 3), with consequent effects on the health of the ecosystems and on human health.  \n \nThis may be illustrated for the UK by considering emissions of sulphur dioxide (SO2). These \nwould constitute a significant entry in the table for ‘Air emissions per sector’ for the electricity \ngeneration sector: power stations are the largest source of SO2 emissions in the UK, emitting 1588 \nthousand tonnes (kt), 67% of total SO2 emissions, in 1995 (DETR, 1997). The next most \nimportant sources of SO2 emissions are other industrial sectors, through their combustion of fossil \nfuels.  \n \nIf emissions are allocated to end users of energy, then industries become the main SO2 emitters \n(843 kt in 1995: 36% of total emissions) followed by the domestic sector (641 kt in 1995: 27% of \ntotal emissions) (DETR, 1997). Use of the framework of Figure 2.1 over time would reveal the \nevolution of SO2 emissions both in terms of quantities and in terms of which sector pollutes. For \nthe first half of the century, SO2 emissions were generated by the combustion of coal, both in the \ndomestic sector, and in commercial and industrial premises and in power stations, which were \nlocated predominantly in towns. The Clean Air Act of 1956, in response to the dense smogs of the \n1950s, mandated the replacement of domestic coal with cleaner fuels, and power generation began \nto be located outside urban areas, using larger power stations with high chimneys which dispersed \nSO2 emissions over large areas. Although national emissions of SO2 have decreased by almost \n60% since 1970, and by 45% since 1980 (DETR, 1997), emissions remain high, and impacts on \necosystems and on humans are still observed. There has, for example,  been much research which \nshows how air pollution can affect some of the characteristics of the atmosphere (for example, \n 10\nchemical composition of the atmosphere, concentration of atmosphere dust, etc.), with consequent \neffects on ecosystems through its interference with the atmosphere’s Life Support functions.  \n \nA serious phenomenon deriving from SO2 pollution is acidification, due to the fact that SO2 \ndissolves in water to give an acidic solution which is readily oxidised to sulphuric acid. Further \ninteractions between SO2 emissions and characteristics of the atmosphere are due to the pollutant \nbeing transported by winds (parameter 1.8), and dissolved by water (precipitation: parameter 1.7), \nwith effects on the life support function 1.4LS (fulfilment of habitat air requirements, see Annex \n3). Forest decline, the disappearance of fish from lakes, and increased susceptibility of plants to \nparasites, pathogens and insect damage have all been attributed to acidification in which SO2 \nemissions play a part. \n \nIn the UK, a computer system developed for mapping the Forestry Commission’s records of forest \nconditions has shown that between 1989 and 1992, a general decline in the conditions of all \nspecies, except Sitka spruce, was observed (Mather et al., 1995). In particular, it was noted that \nthe Norway spruce was being badly affected by sulphur deposition. The phenomenon of forest \ndecline would show up elsewhere in the CRITINC sustainability framework, under the Source \nfunctions of Habitats, since the forest habitat provides a variety of trees. This illustrates again the \nclose interdependency between the four natural capital media, air/atmosphere, water, land/soil and \necosystems/habitats. \n \nThe elevated concentrations of air pollutants, or the effects to which they give rise (including \nclimate change and ozone depletion), may also damage the Human Health and Welfare functions \nof the atmosphere and have unsustainable effects on human health. As an example again, SO2 is \nan irritant when it is inhaled, because of its acidic nature, and high concentrations may cause \nbreathing difficulties in people exposed to it. Recent studies have shown that people with asthma \nmay be especially susceptible to the adverse effects of SO2 and that, within the range of \nconcentrations that occur in pollution episodes, it may provoke attacks of asthma (DoE, 1996b). \n \nSustainability standards may be set to avoid or resolve these problems of adverse effects on the \nthree relevant types of air’s environmental functions. The relevant standards are those which \nmaintain climate stability, ozone shielding, ecosystem function and human health. For climate \nstability, there is a maximum atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases (GGs), from which \nemission limits of GGs may be derived. Similarly, maximum atmospheric concentrations of \nozone-depleting substances (ODSs) may be specified, to protect the ozone layer, from which \nemission limits of ODSs may be derived. Critical loads for threatened ecosystems may be \ndetermined, from which emission limits for pollutants which exceed the critical loads may be \nderived. With regard to human health, maximum concentrations of air pollutants may be set, from \nwhich emission limits may be derived for those pollutants which exceed these concentrations. \n \nIn the case of sulphur dioxide, until relatively recently, air quality guidelines and standards were \nexpressed in conjunction with values for black smoke or other particles (80/779/EEC directive and \nWHO 1987 guidelines). More recent research has addressed the effects of SO2 acting alone, and \nexposures of the order of minutes have been shown to exhibit adverse effects on human health. \nThis has led the Expert Panel on Air Quality Standards (EPAQS) to recommend an air quality \nstandard for SO2 of 110 ppb (parts per billion), measured over a minute averaging period. More \nrecently, the Air Quality Strategy (AQS) for the UK has set a standard of 100 ppb measured as a \n15 minute mean, with a provisional objective to meet this standard at the 99.9th percentile level by \n2005 (DoE, 1996b). In parallel, the WHO guidelines set a figure for a shorter averaging period of \n 11\n175 ppb for a 10 minute mean concentration. The UK Department of the Environment, Transport \nand the Regions  (DETR, 1997) published figures illustrating the details of places where these \nstandards are being exceeded. Thus, for instance, in 1995, the AQS standard was most exceeded in \nBelfast (the number of periods when the 15 minutes concentrations over 100 ppb were recorded \namounted to nearly 900).  \n \nTable 2 gives a selection of sustainability standards and policy targets concerning SO2 emissions. \n \nGuideline set by Description Criteria based on Value, ppb (µg m-3) \nDepartment of the \nEnvironment \nVery good \nGood \nPoor \nVery poor \nPeak hourly average \nconcentration in a 24 \nhour period \n< 60 (160) \n60-124 (160-330) \n125-399 (330-1050) \n≥ 400 (1050) \nEuropean Union \n80/779/EEC \nLimit value Annual (median of \ndaily values over one \nyear) \n30 (80) if smoke >34 \n45 (120) if smoke ≤34 \n Limit value Winter (median of \ndaily values over \nOctober-March) \n49 (130) if smoke > 51 \n68 (180) if smoke ≤51 \n Limit value Annual (98th %ile of \ndaily values) \n94 (250) if smoke >128 \n131 (350)  \nif smoke ≤128 \n Guide value Annual (mean of daily \nvalues) \n15-23 (40-60) \n Guide value 24 hours (daily mean \nvalue) \n38-56 (100-150) \nWHO Health guideline 10 minute mean 175 (500) \n Health guideline 1 hour mean 12 (350) \n Vegetation guideline Daily mean 48 (125) \n Vegetation guideline Annual mean 10 (30) \nUNECE Vegetation guideline Daily mean 26 (70) \n Vegetation guideline Annual mean 8 (20) \n \nTable 2: Selected Standards for SO2  \nSource: Colls, J. (1997) \n \nMuch research has also been carried out concerning critical loads for acid depositions, sometimes \nthrough ecological modelling (CLAG 1995). Critical loads have been defined as the highest \ndepositions of acidifying compounds that will not cause chemical changes leading to long-term \nharmful effects on ecosystem structure and function. They have been estimated using chemical \ncriteria, in the UK, for soils and fresh waters, and maps have been produced, showing places \nwhere the critical loads have been exceeded, depending on the chemical composition of soils, for \ninstance. In the case of water, the critical load is exceeded when the first change in the aquatic \necosystem that can be related to acid deposition occurs. Target loads may be set according to the \nneed to protect any selected individual or groups of species. Dynamic modelling shows that it is \nnot possible to calculate a critical load for surface water without due consideration of the future \nland use policy within a catchment. \n \nThe advantage of specifying the impacts of the same air emissions on each of the different \nenvironmental functions is that it enables sustainability standards to be derived separately for each \nof the functions. The standards may differ, for instance the standard for a particular pollutant may \nbe more stringent with respect to human health than with respect to ecosystems, or vice versa. The \nmore stringent standard is the binding one as far as sustainability is concerned.  \n 12\n \nFor SO2 in the UK, the emission reduction required to close the sustainability gap has been \nestimated as an 80 to 90% reduction from the 1980 level of 4903kt. The monetary sustainability \ngap (M-SGAP) may be derived from this by calculating the costs associated with abating or \navoiding emissions, or restoring environmental functions, such that the sustainability standards are \nmet. Various practical measures have been suggested (e.g. by Halkos, 1993) to reduce SO2 \nemissions. For instance, an 80-90% desulphurisation of heavy fuel oil would involve a capital cost \nof $150/tonne (1985$) and an operating cost of $35/tonne (1985$). \n \n3.2 LAND (inc. SOIL/SPACE/LANDSCAPE) \n \nThe Natural Capital Characteristics for Land, from which its environmental functions derive, are \nshown in Annex 2. For example, 3.13 concerns the concentration of organic matter in soil. \nOrganic matter is important for the development of soil structure and contributes to soil stability. \nIts absorption properties help to regulate the movements of pollutants and contaminants in soil. It \nalso plays an important role in the cycling and storage of plant nutrients, which are vital for food \nproduction, and low organic matter concentration can increase the risk of erosion. In 1995, in the \nUK, concentrations of organic matters exceeding 7% of dry weight were encountered in only 11% \nof the soils sampled, reduced from 22% in 1978-1981 (DoE 1996). This confirms the fact that \nsome agricultural practices have reduced organic matter concentrations in some soils in recent \nyears. \n \nDepletion is most obviously an issue with the Source functions of Land (including \nsoil/space/landscape), one of which is the formation of topsoil and maintenance of soil fertility \n(3.1So in Annex 3). Soil is obviously required for the provision of biomass, a Source function \nwhich is listed under Habitats and ecosystems, and this is another example of the joint \nperformance of an environmental function by different types of natural capital. Economic \nactivities may cause soil erosion or otherwise reduce soil fertility, and result in the depletion of \nmineral resources and fossil fuels. The activities that have a direct effect on the source functions \nare numerous. Extraction of minerals and fossil fuels, the use of land for urban and other types of \ndevelopment, and the impact of modern agriculture not only on space but also directly on the soil, \nare only a few examples of effects on the Source functions of the land. In the UK in 1995 the \nmajor power producers consumed 58 million tonnes of coal, 2.2 million tonnes of fuel oil, and \n145.8 million tonnes of natural gas, while 13.5 million tonnes of gas oil were used in road \ntransport. In 1994, 225 million tonnes of minerals were extracted. The land used for agricultural \nactivities in 1995 covered 18,406 thousand hectares in 1995, corresponding to 75% of the total \nland cover, while 15% of the land was used for urban developments (DoE 1996). The use of \nmodern machinery in agriculture also affects the top soil, compacting it and thereby causing it to \nreact differently to infiltrations, filtering and nutrients. \n  \nThe fertility of soil is determined by factors such as nutrient contents and acidity levels. \nMaintaining an adequate supply of nutrients is important to obtain an optimum crop performance. \nHowever, the amount of these nutrients should not be excessive, in order to avoid polluting effects \n(eutrophication, etc.). With regard to soil acidity, pH-6 - pH-7 is the optimum range of acidity for \narable soils. If soils become more acidic than pH6, the yields of some arable crops may be \nreduced. The proportion of relatively acidic fields in the UK has increased since 1969. \n \nThe depletion of minerals, for example through quarrying, can create voids for waste disposal, so \nthat in such cases not only can the same space perform Source and Sink functions in sequence, but \n 13\nthe Source activity actually improves the Sink potential (for discussion of the sustainability of \nwhich see below).  \n \nThe mechanisation of agriculture mentioned above also affects the capacity of the soil to \ndecompose, disperse and dilute the emissions to land because of the change of structure of the \nsoil. So agriculture affects the Sink function in a ‘physical/ structural’ way. It also affects this \nfunction through the polluting substances it emits to the soil, hence contributing to some forms of \nsoil contamination.  \n \nThe winning of mineral resources, through mining or quarrying, often conflicts with the Life \nSupport functions of land in respect of habitats and ecosystems The use of land for various \neconomic activities restricts the space available for natural habitats.  \n \nFinally, the degradation of soil, or the extraction of mineral resources and fossil fuels, can have an \nimpact on the Human Health and Welfare (HW) functions of land, especially by changing land \nuse and landscapes. The impacts that are most often observed in relation to this fourth type of \nenvironmental function relate to the availability of space for recreation and leisure, which is \nespecially important for urban communities. Urban developments that do not put enough emphasis \non green space may have a serious effect on human health and welfare.  \n \nAll material derived from the Earth’s crust through the performance of the Source functions of \nland will ultimately be returned to the environment, much of it as emissions to land from different \nsectors of economic activity. Through land contamination these emissions can reduce soil fertility \nor render space unusable for other activities, thereby impacting on land’s Source functions; they \ncan overwhelm the Sink functions of soil and space; they can displace or pollute habitats and \necosystems; and they can impair the HW functions of enabling recreation and the enjoyment of \nlandscapes.  \n \nSome work has been done to map the concentrations of some of the most important heavy metals \nin agricultural top soils in England and Wales. These maps (DETR, 1996) show that the range of \nvalues for each metal can be large, with the upper values above those recommended for the \ncontrol of soil pollution. Elevated concentrations are mainly found in areas of heavy past or \npresent industrial activities. \n \nThe eventual impacts of emissions to land well illustrate the interactions between environmental \nmedia and between different types of environmental function (DETR, 1997). Examples of the \nformer include the leaching of wastes from landfill sites (when they were emissions to land) into \nwater courses (when they become emissions to water), and the decomposition of wastes in landfill \nsites to produce methane, a greenhouse gas, which can also be used as an energy source (when an \nemission to land produces emissions to air, or evolves a new Source function). Similarly, \nemissions to land can enter the food chain and have a negative impact on the way habitats and \necosystems can fulfil their Source functions. \n \nApplication of sustainability standards to each of the types of affected environmental functions, \nshown in Level 3 of Figure 2.1, leads various constraints. \n \nTo maintain the Source functions at a sustainable level, top soil should not be lost faster than it is \ncreated, and it should exceed minimum standards for soil structure and organic content. The Royal \nCommission on Environmental Pollution advised that the minimum rate of application of organic \n 14\ncompounds must be stated as to provide no less than 500 grammes organic matter (dry weight) per \nm2 of ground. There are also some limits for nutrients loads, such as total nitrogen (8g/m2), total \nphosphate (6g/m2) or total potash (12 g/m2). These are closely related to the fertility of the soil \n(Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution, 1996). Non-renewable sub-soil resources should \nbe used such that a minimum life expectancy of the resource is maintained, and renewable \nsubstitutes for the resource are developed. \n \nTo maintain the Sink functions of land, there should be maximum rates of disposal to land, \nconsistent with constraints of space, and the leaching of wastes from landfill sites should be \nminimised or avoided altogether. Methane from landfill sites should be used as an energy source. \nSome detailed work has been carried out on the disposal of wastes and limits to the quantity of \ncertain types of wastes that a landfill will be able to 'deal with' before infiltrations of pollutants \npass through the soil and perhaps pollute groundwater, depending on the nature of the soil, the \nnature of the wastes, the interaction between pollutants, etc. More general studies indicate a \nnecessary reduction of 80-90% of the annual amount of wastes disposal, and such figures are \nsometimes cited as a ‘sustainability target’ (Department of the Environment and the Welsh Office, \n1995; Ekins and Simon, 1999). Policy targets which have been adopted include the reduction in \nthe proportion of wastes going to landfill from 70% to 60% by 2005, and the recovery of 40% of \nmunicipal wastes by 2005.  While they may push waste management in the right direction, such \ntargets do not relate explicitly to sustainability standards. One way of deriving sustainability \nstandards for wastes would be through a reconceptualisation of wastes as by-products, all of which \ncould be used as an input for other production processes. \n \nThere are also some sustainability standards related to Land’s Sink functions that are expressed in \nterms of thresholds of concentrations of pollutants that contaminate the soil. Thus, for example, no \nproduct may contain amounts of the following elements in concentration greater than the \nfollowing values, measured in terms of dry weight (mg/kg): zinc: 300; copper: 75; nickel: 50; \nlead: 140, etc. (DoE 1996). Some critical loads for acidity of soils have also been calculated. \nSimilarly, there are some standards for eutrophying substances, based on the principle that the \nland should not be supplied with more nutrients than the agricultural crop can absorb. \n \nTo maintain Land’s Life Support functions, occupation of space, whether for mining and \nquarrying, or for disposal of wastes to land, should not be allowed to degrade soil. Important \necosystems should receive statutory protection from displacement by other activities. Standards of \nprotection might be defined in terms of the space needed for certain habitats and ecosystems. \nClearly such standards would need to relate very closely to the different kinds of ecosystems to \nwhich they refer. \n \nThe performance of Land’s Human Health and Welfare functions requires that toxic wastes \ndisposed of to land must not be allowed to enter the food chain; access to land for recreation \nshould be safeguarded; and important areas of landscape should be protected. \n \nThe physical ‘sustainability gap’ for land may be expressed by a number of indicators: excessive \nloss of topsoil; lack of organic content in soil; unsustainable use of non-renewable resources; \nexcessive disposal of wastes to landfill; excessive leaching of landfill wastes into the environment; \ncontinuing loss, or inadequate restoration, of important ecosystems; pollution of ecosystems from \ncontaminated land; damage to human health from contaminated land or from wastes disposed of \nto land; continuing loss, or failure to protect, important landscapes. The monetary sustainability \n 15\ngap (M-SGAP) may be derived from these indicators by calculating in each case the costs \nassociated with restoring environmental functions, such that the sustainability standards are met. \n \nIn some cases, as with many of the effects on the atmosphere and on water, unsustainable effects \non Land may be reversible (e.g. much land contamination) at a cost. Some effects, however, are \nirreversible, including, especially, the loss of ecosystems and their associated species as a result of \nchanges in land use, and the loss of valued landscapes. Also irreversible is the depletion of fossil \nfuels, and it is still not clear that substitutes for these are being developed at an adequate rate to \navoid economic disruption from energy shortages. \n \n3.3 HABITATS (inc. ECOSYSTEMS, FLORA & FAUNA, BIOMASS) \n \nIt may immediately be noted from Annex 2 that there are many more natural capital characteristics \nfor this type of natural capital than for other types, because of the relative complexity of \necosystems and habitats, compared with air, water and land. To take an example, characteristic 4.8 \ngives information on the population and diversity of fish species. With regard to one UK species, \nhaddock, after 1968 there was a dramatic collapse in the stock, which has continued to decline. \nStocks fell from 6000 thousand tonnes in 1968 to just above 2000 thousand tonnes in 1969, while \nin 1995 the overall stock of haddock in the North Sea was just below 1000 thousand tonnes. The \nNorth Sea herring population was also seriously affected by over-fishing in the 1970s and the \nfishery was closed between 1978 and 1982, allowing stocks to recover. Herring stocks have \ndeclined again since their peak in the mid-1980s. Emergency measures were taken in 1996 to \nprevent closure of the fishery. An important fact is that trends vary considerably between species, \ndue to different economic impacts and also to differing ecosystem reactions.  \n \n The natural capital characteristics of Habitats give rise to their environmental functions, grouped \nas usual into Source, Sink, Life Support and Human Health and Welfare functions, and listed in \nAnnex 3.  \n \nA characteristic of the Source functions is that they are potentially renewable, that is, their use \nbelow some maximum sustainable level does not deplete the resource. However, current usage \nrates of many renewable resources (e.g. fish, tropical timber) are substantially higher than the \nmaximum sustainable levels, so that the stocks of these resources are being rapidly depleted. \nWhere deforestation, for example, involves laying soil bare, especially on steep inclines, soil \nerosion will reduce the ability of land to produce biomass.  The loss of primary productive \npotential, through soil erosion and the loss of vegetation and other stocks of biomass, is one of the \nmost alarming aspects of current global environmental change.  \n \nOne of the characteristics of (non-human) natural systems and cycles is that there is little room for \nthe concept of waste. The outputs of one part of the system or cycle become the inputs of another, \nwith the ecosystem performing any necessary transformation for this to be able to take place. \nEcosystems such as forests can perform this Sink function to some extent with wastes from human \nactivities, but excessive emissions, as well as over-harvesting of biomass, and the resulting soil \nerosion, reduces their ability to carry it out.  \n \nBiomass stocks can be reduced (or made ‘non usable’) through pollution as well as through \nexcessive harvesting. Thus, with regard to the contamination of fish by metals and pesticides, in \nthe UK in 1994 cod had an average of 3.8 mg/kg wet weight of zinc, 2.3 mg/kg wet weight of \n 16\nPCBs, and 0.1 mg/ kg wet weight of dieldrin (DETR 1997). Reduced growth or die-back in trees \nis another effect of pollution on the Source function of Habitats.  \n \nThe Life Support capabilities and functions of habitats are obviously their most important \nattributes. Again, the excessive harvesting and depletion of renewable resources interferes greatly \nwith these functions, not least through the reduction of biological and genetic diversity. The \neconomic activities impacting upon these functions include agriculture and urban development, \nsince they alter the habitat structure. For instance, agriculture affects the medium-scale habitat by \nchanging the land use, replacing existing ecosystems with agricultural fields. It also affects the \necosystem/ habitat within the soil (fertility, decomposition mechanisms, transfers of nutrients, \netc.). In the UK in 1995, 75% of the country was agricultural land, with forest and urban use \naccounting for the remaining 10% and 15% respectively. Almost half of the 46 species found on \nfarmland have declined in numbers over the last twenty years. \n \nFinally, the depletion of renewable resources can have a direct impact on the Human Health and \nWelfare (HW) functions of habitats and ecosystems, as once biodiverse, varied and fertile \nlandscapes are converted to large areas of monoculture or even degraded land that can produce \nlittle biomass of any kind.  \n \nAll biomass used by human activity through the performance of Habitats’ Source function 4.4So \nwill ultimately be returned to the environment as wastes, and may be related to different sectors of \neconomic activity. Unlike materials from the Earth’s crust, or synthetic, human-made materials, \nthese wastes are normally degraded fairly easily through natural processes. However, if in excess, \nthe wastes still have considerable potential to disrupt ecosystems and affect all their different \ntypes of functions.  \n \nThe eventual impacts of biomass wastes, as with emissions to land, also well illustrate the \ninteractions between environmental media and between different types of environmental function. \nWhen biomass is burnt it contributes to air pollution. Wastes from livestock start off as emissions \nto land, but can cause serious pollution of water courses.  \n \nFor the sustainable performance of Habitats’ Source functions, soil cover should be maintained to \nlimit soil erosion. Biomass stocks should be maintained at biologically acceptable levels and the \nharvesting of all renewable resources should be carried out at sustainable levels. For fish the \nMinimum Biological Acceptable Level (MBAL) corresponds to the level below which there is an \nincreasing risk that the reproductive potential of the stock will collapse. The percentage of stocks \nfished by the UK fishing fleets and other international fleets which was above the MBAL reached \na peak of 63% in 1993 and decreased to 42% in 1994 (DoE 1996). A more recent UK Government \npublication (DETR 1999, p.207) noted that the mix of species used by the International Council \nfor the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) to calculate the MBAL is not consistent from stock to stock \nor from year to year. As a consequence, the MBAL measures are now not used by the UK \nGovernment, being replaced by the categorisation of stocks as being within or outside the safe \nbiological limits based on the spawning stock size and the fishing rate. DETR (1999) reports on \nthe basis of this indicator that, in 1997, 49% of fish stocks had spawning levels which were \ninsufficient to guarantee stock replenishment. Other criteria such as the minimum critical \necosystem size, which may also be used as a sustainability standard, might also be adopted for \ncertain species.  \n \n 17\nTo maintain Habitats’ Sink functions, biomass wastes should be disposed of such that they are \nable to be reabsorbed into natural cycles. Methane from landfill sites should be used as an energy \nsource. The maintenance of Habitats’ Life Support functions require that emissions of biomass \nwastes must be limited such that critical loads for eco-system disruption are not exceeded. The \nrichness and diversity of species in ecosystems must be maintained, as well as ecosystems’ \nstructure, function and resilience. Similarly the continuing performance of Habitats’ Human \nHealth and Welfare functions requires that species, habitats and ecosystems that are important for \nrecreation and inspiration should be protected \n \nThe physical ‘sustainability gap’ for habitats and ecosystems may be expressed by a number of \nindicators: the extent to which biomass stocks have fallen below minimum biologically acceptable \nlevels (MBAL), and harvests are above (conservatively estimated) maximum sustainable yields; \nloss of species richness or diversity, or disappearnace of certain habitats; excess of biomass wastes \nover critical loads; excess concentration of such wastes in ecosystems (e.g. excessive biological \noxygen demand in freshwater ecosystems); continuing loss, or failure to protect, ecosystems with \nimportant aesthetic or recreational functions. The monetary sustainability gap (M-SGAP) may be \nderived from these indicators by calculating in each case the costs associated with restoring \nenvironmental functions, such that the sustainability standards are met. However, in many cases \nhabitats, with their associated ecosystems and species, cannot be recreated or restored. The \nextinction of species is also irreversible.  \n \n \n4 CONCLUSION \n \nThis paper has presented an integrated framework, the CRITINC framework, for accounting for \nand analysing the interactions between the economy and the environment, with the purpose of \nidentifying the extent to which current uses of the environment are unsustainable and the activities \nwhich are responsible for such uses. \n \nUnsustainable uses are those which reduce, or threaten to reduce, the ability of the environment to \ncarry out its Source, Sink, Life Support and Human Health and Welfare functions. These functions \nderive from the Natural Capital Characteristics of the four environmental media: Air/atmosphere; \nWater; Land (including soil/space/landscape); and Habitats/Ecosystems. By presenting the \nfunctions and characteristics in the same Figure as the economic activities which have impacts on \nthem, it is possible to track these impacts and discover to what extent the impacts need to be \nreduced, and/or various characteristics of the environment need to be restored, in order for \nstandards of sustainable use of the environmental functions to be achieved. This information is of \nconsiderable importance to those seeking to formulate environmental policy. \n \nThe framework has been presented and discussed with the environment being conceived in terms \nof natural capital. There is much logic in this, for much of the environment functions as a stock of \nphysical things which give rise to flows of matter and energy which are the source of the various \nenvironmental functions. However, just as important as the physical things themselves in the \nperformance of environmental functions are the relationships and interactions between them. It is \nonly comparatively rarely possible to identify particular functions with particular physical stocks. \nMore often the functions come about as a result of interactions and processes between many \ndifferent physical elements, which may also be considerably spread out over space and time. Thus \nCritical Natural Capital, those elements of the environment which are essential for environmental \nsustainability, should be considered in terms of physical environmental ‘assets’ plus a whole host \n 18\nof sometimes very complex interactions between them. This makes it more difficult to be sure \nwhich physical elements of the environment need to be conserved for environmental \nsustainability. It also counsels caution with regard to the possible loss of some of these elements, \nfor although they may not seem important in themselves, they may be necessary for wider \ninteractions that are obviously important. Doubtless over time environmental science will clarify \nsome of these areas of uncertainty. But it seems likely that it will not be reduced to an \ninsignificant level for a considerable period to come. The CRITINC framework itself can cast \nlight on these uncertainties and show how policy makers need to modify economic activities if \nundesirable risks to society are to be avoided. \n \n \nREFERENCES \n \nCLAG (Critical Loads Advisory Group) 1995 Critical Loads of Acid Deposition for United \nKingdom Freshwaters, Department of the Environment, London \n \nColls, J. 1997 Air Pollution, an Introduction, E&FN Spon, London \n \nDe Groot, R.S. 1992 Functions of Nature, Wolters-Noordhoff, Groningen, Netherlands \n \nDoE (Department of the Environment) 1996a Indicators of Sustainable Development for the UK, \nHMSO, London. \n \nDoE (Department of the Environment) 1996b The United Kingdom National Air Quality Strategy: \nConsultation Draft, DoE, London \n \nDepartment of the Environment and the Welsh Office 1995 Making Waste Work.

This involves classifying the characteristics of natural capital and the environmental functions to which it gives rise, and then defining standards of environmental sustainability for these functions. The framework then relates these functions to the economic system, through the input/output tables, in order to identify the pressures on the functions and hence the extent to which the functions are not being maintained at a sustainable level. The framework is worked though in some detail for water, with less detailed application of it to air, land and habitats. The methodology can be used to identify areas of environmental unsustainability and the processes to which this unsustainability is due, so that policies to move towards sustainability may be more easily identified.</dc:description><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>http://oro.open.ac.uk/23/1/Sandrine_EcologicalEconomicsPublicat.pdf</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:source>0921-8009</dc:source><dc:title>An illustrative application of the CRITINC framework to the UK</dc:title><rioxxterms:author>Ekins, Paul</rioxxterms:author><rioxxterms:author>Simon, Sandrine</rioxxterms:author><rioxxterms:publication_date>2003-03</rioxxterms:publication_date><rioxxterms:type>Journal Article/Review</rioxxterms:type><rioxxterms:version>NA</rioxxterms:version><rioxxterms:version_of_record>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0921-8009(02)00277-X</rioxxterms:version_of_record></rioxx></metadata></record>",
