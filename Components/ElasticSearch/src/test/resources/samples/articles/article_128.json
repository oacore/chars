This work is based upon a literature \nreview and themes highlighted from depth interviews with leading edge services \nbranding consultants.  Values tend to be communicated to consumers via their \nexperience of the brand as a whole, including their interactions with employees, \nexternal brand communications and the tangible elements of the service offering.  \nFor employees, values are communicated via HR practices and policies, internal and \nexternal brand communications and the example set by senior managers.    \n \nIntroduction \n \nA brand can be defined as a cluster of functional and emotional values that promise a \nunique and welcomed experience for the stakeholder.  The classical, FMCG branding \nmodel focuses upon finding market gaps, devising an offering with a cluster of values \nto satisfy customers, then a mechanistic production process gives functional benefits \nwhich are enrobed with emotional values through advertising.  As developed \neconomies have moved from a manufacturing to a services base, the classical brand \nbuilding model needs revising (Berry 2000).  Organisations are becoming more \nvalues-driven, recognising that staff are key ambassadors in the brand building \nprocess.  The functional and emotional values of services brands are highly \ndependent on the staff who deliver the brand promise (Ind 2001; Nguyen and \nLeblanc 2002).  We argue that organisations should not primarily focus upon \ncustomers’ value needs, assuming staff to be passive conduits, but staff must be \ntaken into consideration as they are actively involved in the services branding \nprocess. \n \nWithin this perspective of a new paradigm for services branding, the focus shifts to \ngaining a competitive advantage through being more attentive to internal values.  \nYet, how are consumers made aware of services brands’ values – can we continue \nto rely on advertising?  How are staff made aware of their brands’ values?  Due to \nthe limited research that has been undertaken in this domain, we sought to advance \nknowledge through investigating this issue.  This paper opens by reviewing the \nliterature on the communication of values, both within the organisation and externally \nto consumers.  The paper then explains how depth interviews were undertaken with \nsenior brand consultants specialising in services branding.  Our findings about the \nways in which organisational values and culture are communicated to staff and \nconsumers are explained.  Finally, the overall implications of the results are \nconsidered. \n \nLiterature Review \n \nThe seminal writer Rokeach defined a value as, ‘…an enduring belief that a specific \nmode of conduct or end-state of existence is personally or \nsocially preferable to an opposite or converse mode of conduct or end-state of \nexistence’ (1973, p.5).  This paper considers how the values of an organisation are \ncommunicated to staff and consumers via corporate communication.  Three primary \ntypes of corporate communication have been identified - management, marketing \nand organisational (van Riel 1995).  Management communication refers to messages \nconveyed by management to both internal and external stakeholders.  Marketing \ncommunications are those directly aimed towards the consumer, eg. advertising, \ndirect mail, personal selling and sponsorship.  Organisational communication covers \nall other communications based within an organisation, such as PR, public affairs, \nenvironmental communications, investor relations and internal communication. We \n1 \nhold that values communication to staff occurs primarily through a combination of \nmanagement and organisational communication, whereas consumers learn about the \norganisation’s values mainly through marketing and organisational communication.  \nWe next consider in more detail the ways in which values are communicated to \nemployees and to consumers.   \n \nHow are organisational values communicated to staff? \n \nCommunicating the values effectively to employees is critical when seeking \nconsistent, value-congruent employee behaviour (Gotsi and Wilson 2001; Nguyen \nand Leblanc 2002; Ind 2001), though employees also have to accept and internalise \nthese to ‘live the brand’ within the organisation and in their interactions with \nconsumers. Organisational and management communication (van Riel 1995) are the \nmain ways in which values are communicated to staff.  Organisational \ncommunication includes both recruitment and selection and the various channels \nthrough which socialisation occurs once an employee has joined the organisation (eg \nHR processes, mentoring, story-telling, rites and rituals and the encoding of the \nvalues into a values statement).   Management communication may occur directly, \nbut is also through management’s function as a ‘role model’.  Marketing \ncommunication in the form of advertising may play a role, albeit a minor one.  \n \nRecruitment and selection facilitate the initial communication of values (Davidson \n2002), via the recruitment processes and literature.  Klein and Weaver (2000) found \nthat attending an induction programme positively influenced awareness and \nacceptance of values. Also, some self-selection will occur, as it is likely that only \npeople accepting of the values will see through the recruitment process.  Employees \nwith values congruent to those of the organisation are likely to feel and act more \nfavourably towards it (Harris and Mossholder 1996).  However, as Cable et al (2000, \n1083) note, ‘…firms may try to overstate desired values to applicants’, and  may be \nguilty of, ‘….trying to attract as many applicants from competitors as possible rather \nthan allowing applicants to self-select on the basis of accurate culture information’.    \n \nThe process by which individuals absorb the organisational values once recruited is \nknown as ‘socialisation’.  It is, ‘….the process of “learning the ropes”….the process of \nbeing taught what is important in an organization…’ (Schein 1988, 54).  This occurs \nvia a range of organisational communications.   Although recruitment processes \nencourage the hiring of candidates with values congruent to the organisation, they \ncan still be expected to have some values which are incongruent.  There may \ntherefore be a destructive stage, which, ‘…serves the function of detaching the \nperson from his former values…..’ (Schein 1988, 54).  This might include ‘upending \nexperiences’, engineered to ‘…upset or disconfirm some of the major assumptions \nwhich the new man holds about himself, his company or his job’ (Schein 1988, 55), \nfor example lengthy training.   \n \nA variety of HR processes can be harnessed to further the socialisation process, \nsuch as hiring methods, performance management systems, criteria for promotions \nand rewards, and dismissal policies (Lencioni 2002).  Begley and Boyd (2000) refer \nto Bell Atlantic, which following a merger with NYNEX redesigned their reward \nstructures to promote the key values of the new culture.  However, the degree to \nwhich HR activities are congruent with the values varies considerably. For example, \nwhile Davidson (2002) notes the importance of linking appraisal and reward systems \nto the organisation’s values, he accepts that this is often incomplete or inconsistent. \n \nNew employees will obtain some of their knowledge about the organisation’s values \nfrom employees.  Whilst this may be a casual process, it may also occur as formal \n 2\nmentoring.  However, the success of this depends on factors such as the mentor’s \nskill in teaching/mentoring and the mentor’s views about, and interpretation of, the \norganisation’s values (Swap et al 2001).   Story-telling within organisations can be \nharnessed to transmit values to employees.  Hallam (2003) examined Washington \nMutual’s communication of its values to employees, noting the effectiveness of \nincluding brand value-related stories and examples in publications such as the \ncompany newsletter.  \n \nA range of rites and rituals may contribute to communicating and reinforcing values.  \nThese are the ‘artefacts’ within Schein’s (1984) model of organisational culture.  \nWhile artefacts are related to organisational values, it is not always easy to infer the \ncorrect values.  Another artefact from which employees may gain clues about the \norganisation’s values is advertisements intended for consumers’ attention \n(Wolfinbarger and Gilly 1991). Some form of initiation rite may also mark the \ntransition of an employee to full member status, the final stage of socialisation where \nthe organisation’s values are, hopefully, fully accepted by the individual.   \n \nEncoding the values in a values statement forms the basis for internal and external \nmarketing communications within many organisations.  However, Lencioni (2002, 5) \nhighlights the problem of ‘empty’ or dishonest values which may, ‘….create cynical \nand dispirited employees, alienate customers, and undermine managerial credibility’.   \nEven if the values are genuine, their communication must involve more than \ncodification.  Lencioni (2002) offers the example of Nordstrom, where values are \nwoven into stories of exceptional customer service.  Also, in order to effectively \ncommunicate values, it is important that employees are not only told but also \ninvolved – for example, when KPMG implemented its new values program in 1998 it \nintroduced a monopoly-type board game based on the KPMG values which elicited \nconsiderable enthusiasm from staff (Thornbury 1999). \n \nManagement communication, in the form of the example set by an organisation’s \nCEO and their function as a role model has great power communicating values to \nemployees (Dauphinais and Price 1998; Giblin and Amuso 1997).  The behaviour of \nsenior management should not contradict the values of the organisation. Griseri \n(1998, 202) notes that, ‘when there is a misfit between statement and behaviour it is \nnot usual that the verbal evidence outweighs the physical’.  One-off ‘rallies’ or \n‘roadshows’ can also be used to convey values to employees; these are often utilised \nat pivotal times, for example values change initiatives, and commonly involve the \nCEO or senior managers (Hallam 2003).   \n \nNot all organisations are successful in their efforts to communicate their values.  \nEdmondson and Cha (2002) considered the case of Maverick Advertising, and the \ndamage caused to staff morale when employees interpreted the organisation’s \ncommunicated values incorrectly.  Ginsburg and Miller (1992, 23) found that ‘…for \nmany firms, corporate values, if addressed at all were only cited in advertisements, \npress releases and company newsletters’, and they highlight, ‘…significant gaps \nbetween the ideal and the real that are attributable to a lack of clarity or \nunderstanding’.  Dobni et al (2000) recommend that managers frequently check \nemployees’ understanding of the values, for example through surveys and \ndiscussion. \n \nHow are organisational values communicated to consumers? \n \nAs corporate image emerges from consumers’ interpretations of organisational \nvalues, we therefore decided to draw upon the corporate image literature to clarify \nhow organisational values are communicated to consumers. van Riel (1995, 73) \n 3\ndefines image as, ‘…the set of meanings by which an object is known and through \nwhich people describe, remember and relate to it’.  Nguyen and Leblanc (2002, 244) \nconsider the factors which influence corporate image. They found that organisational \ncommunication via ‘contact elements’ were an important channel through which \nconsumers gain information about values.  ‘Contact elements’ include both customer \nfocusing staff and the physical environment in which the service is provided.  \nHowever, they noted that marketing communications also play a role in the \ncommunication of values to consumers. \n \nDavies and Chun (2002) believe that consumers’ interactions with employees during \nservice encounters are a frequent way of communicating values.  If efforts to \ncommunicate the values to employees have succeeded, and if employees have \ninternalised the values to the point where they are actually ‘living the brand’, then this \ncannot fail to be noticed by the consumer.  This was understood by Hewlett Packard, \nwho focused upon bringing consistency to the external brand experience through \nensuring all employees are au fait with the brand values (Mellor 1999).  However, the \nemployee is not the sole channel via which consumers receive communications \nabout values; other channels include corporate name, communications strategy, \nother external marketing activities and word of mouth (Nguyen and Leblanc 2000).   \n \nThe fact that an organisation’s values are communicated to consumers via \nemployees, and via other channels raises the issue of the extent to which these are \nintegrated. Unless complementary values are being communicated to both \nemployees and consumers, corporate image may not reflect corporate identity, which \ncould weaken the brand.  Hatch and Schultz (2001) identify a number of gaps where \nthis disconnect may occur, including the ‘image-culture gap’ which ‘leads to \nconfusion among customers about what a company stands for’, and ‘…usually \nmeans that a company does not practise what it preaches’ (Hatch and Schultz 2001, \n131).   \n \nResearch Aim and Method  \n \nThe aim of this paper is to understand how the custodians of successful services \nbrands make consumers and staff aware of the values of the organisation.    \n \nDepth interviews were conducted with senior consultants within the UK specialising \nin the management of services brands, and who had considerable knowledge and \nexperience of services branding.  As noted by Locke (2001), all sampling in \nqualitative research is deliberate or purposeful, in that researchers select \nrespondents in order to get the best quality data about a given subject.  In line with \nthis, in  order to obtain data about the communication of services brand values we \napproached consultants who held senior positions, typically at the level of Managing \nDirector or Director, in agencies specialising in advising clients about brand \nmarketing (the one exception was a management journalist acknowledged for his \nvisionary brand writing). They were either frequent presenters at management \nconferences on branding, have written books or papers on branding, or were \nrecommended by other experts. While research into brands has traditionally focused \nupon the opinions of brand managers, we chose instead to interview consultants.  \nWe felt that managers are often driven by short-term situational factors, whilst \nconsultants are more commonly engaged in long-term brand planning.  It was also \nour view that leading-edge knowledge and ideas about branding are more likely to \nflow from consultants to managers than vice versa, and within the management \npress, authors have been critical of the lack of vision and understanding which brand \nmanagers have of branding issues (Mitchell 1994).   \n \n 4\nGiven the exploratory nature of the research, we did not wish to impose our \npreconceptions upon respondents; rather, we wanted to obtain respondents’ views \nwithin their own frames of reference.  A topic guide was used to steer the overall \nthemes discussed. One of the questions asked was ‘How do successful services \nbrands make customers and staff aware of their values?’.  Respondents were \nallowed to talk as much or as little as they wished, with us intervening only to obtain \nfurther clarification of comments when required.   \n \n28 depth interviews were conducted, with the sample consisting of 10 advertising \nconsultants, 5 brand consultants, 5 design consultants, 4 marketing/management \nconsultants, 3 market research consultants and a management journalist.  This paper \nfocuses on one question within the topic guide into experts’ views about service \nbranding, and includes data from 23 respondents.  The interviews were recorded and \ntranscribed.  The codes arose naturally during the coding of the data, rather than \nbeing pre-specified.  Two authors coded the data separately in line with accepted \npractice (Krippendorff 1980), and then the inter-coder reliability was calculated (using \nthe coefficient of agreement) to be 87.7%.  Any differences in interpretation between \nthe coders were resolved via discussion and reference back to the transcripts (Miles \nand Huberman 1994).   \n \nFindings \n \nThe themes which arose from our research are outlined below.  Whilst this work was \nof a qualitative nature, we will include some indication of the numbers of respondents \nbacking a particular theme, as we feel that this gives a more comprehensive picture \nof the data. \n \nHow do successful services brands make staff aware of their values? \n \nThe most widely quoted way in which respondents believed organisational values are \ncommunicated to employees of successful services brands was through various \nforms of internal communication (mentioned by 14 respondents).  Whilst codifying the \nvalues (for example, providing employees with a wallet-sized card listing the values) \nwas mentioned by 2 respondents, the majority echoed the literature in that a more \ninteractive approach to the internal communication of values was needed.  \nComments included: ‘you’ve got to have proactive communications programmes to \nstart with’ (Marketing Consultant 4), and that ‘successful companies….have well \norganised ways of communicating to people…face to face if they can’ (Advertising \nConsultant 7).  One respondent noted that this tended to occur in a ‘ripple’ effect, as \nthe values are communicated to a key group first, who then, ‘communicate it to the \nnext tier of staff and ripple out the message’ (Design Consultant 5).  Specific internal \ncommunication techniques which were quoted included newsletters, workshops, \nconferences and seminars and away days. One respondent discussed internal \nadvertising, but noted that, ‘the whole concept…is in its absolute infancy’ (Advertising \nConsultant 8).  Technological methods, such as intranets or television channels \ncreated specifically for employees within the organisation were also mentioned.  As \nsuggested by Wolfinbarger and Gilly (1991), it was also acknowledged that external \ncommunications, particularly advertising, influences employees’ perceptions of the \nbrand values.   It was commented that, ‘it’s a very effective way of communicating \nwith your staff for good or ill….that sends out a message that the staff inevitably \nreceive that they are aware that everyone else is receiving…’ (Advertising Consultant \n9).  \n \nSpecifically, the importance of senior members of the organisation in the values \ncommunication process was mentioned by 7 respondents.  In line with the literature, \n 5\nthe CEO and other senior members were seen to communicate the values by \nexample through their actions, by ‘living it from the top’ (Advertising Consultant 10).  \nAlso, communicating the values to employees by whatever means was likely to be \nmore successful if the process was seen to be supported from the top of the \norganisation – ‘if the managing director comes to the training session that sends \nquite a different message than if the managing director comes to the training session \nfor the first 10 minutes and says….now I’ve got real work to do and leaves’ \n(Advertising Consultant 9).   \n \nThe other principal way in which the respondents felt staff were made aware of \nvalues was through the HR function.  9 respondents specifically referred to the \nprocesses of selection, induction and training.  This echoes Davidson’s (2002) view, \nin that the initial way in which the values are presented to employees is critical, but \nalso reflects the importance of ongoing training after induction has ended.  \nComments included: ‘we will employ people who believe in our approach rather than \nwho have our skills…or qualifications’ (Management Journalist), and ‘HR runs \ntraining…they are imparting messages and hopefully values through to staff’ \n(Marketing Consultant 2).  In line with Lencioni (2002), other areas which were \nmentioned were review and appraisal, reward structures and staff motivation.  One \nrespondent discussed the importance of training, but also offered the caveat that it is \nalso, ‘…about actually getting the working conditions right as well so that everything \ncan be taken on in a positive frame of mind’ (Marketing Research Consultant 1), \nreflecting the way in which employee satisfaction is noted in the literature as a \nprerequisite for the values to be internalised.   \n \n9 respondents commented upon the general lack of success or failure factors faced \nin the communication of services brands’ values to employees. Rather than involving \nstaff and therefore encouraging the internalisation of and genuine belief in values, the \nvalues were often being communicated in a very passive way.  Comments included: \n‘if you can do something that allows people to internalise it, they are going to know it \nand remember it….if you stand up at the front and present it you probably won’t get \nquite such a good result’ (Advertising Consultant 3).   Also, it was noted that often the \nvalues were not clarified and understood by employees, and that ‘you have to \ndescribe their relevance and describe their benefits and to then make people see the \nbenefits of change’ (Design Consultant 5). A number of respondents went as far as to \nsay that the communication of values needed to be a two-way process.  5 \nrespondents believed that feedback on the values from employees was necessary – \nit was noted that,  ‘it almost has to become more democratic….they have to build the \norganisation around their people, rather than making sure that their people fit into the \norganisation’ (Management Journalist). \n \nHow do successful services brands make consumers aware of their values? \n \nOur data indicated that the main ways in which services brands make consumers \naware of their values are via the service experience as a whole, through direct brand \ncommunications, by demonstrating through the behaviour of employees and by \ninference from the tangible elements of the service offering.  Another finding which \nemerged was that consistency in communicating the brand values was vital, \nwhichever way the values were communicated.   \n \n9 believed that consumers’ experience of the brand overall was how services brand \nvalues were communicated, in a holistic sense.  It was noted that, ‘every point of \ncontact between the customer and the company is a moment of truth…action speaks \nlouder than words’ (Management Journalist), and that, ‘every experience must be \nreinforced’ (Brand Consultant 4).   One respondent explained that an organisation’s \n 6\nespoused values were not real until they touched the consumer – ‘if the consumer \ndoesn’t experience it on the ground, then the values do not really exist’ (Advertising \nConsultant 10).   \n \nThe same number, 9 of the 23 respondents noted that brand communications such \nas advertising and PR were an important way in which services brand values were \ncommunicated to consumers. One respondent highlighted the fact that external \nbrand communications were helpful, ‘to remind the customer facing members of the \ncompany how they should behave’ (Advertising Consultant 10).  However, a number \nof respondents stated that they felt the overall brand experience at the point of \nservice was the primary factor, particularly as advertising will be ‘synergistic with the \nvalues but it won’t necessarily say what those values are’ (Marketing Consultant 1).   \n \nInterestingly, the importance of employees demonstrating the brand values through \ntheir behaviour was raised specifically by only 4 respondents, with comments \nincluding: ‘it does come down to walking the talk’ (Market Research Consultant 3) \nand ‘…that’s via the attitude of many of the people living the brand’ (Design \nConsultant 1).  However, it is likely that those respondents who stated the holistic \nbrand experience as the prime channel for communicating values had included the \nbehaviour of employees as an implicit factor.  Other tangible elements which are \nexperienced during the service interaction were also seen as playing a role in the \ncommunication of the brand values by 3 respondents, particularly the physical \nenvironment in which the service experience takes place and other visible cues such \nas codes of dress.  As one respondent put it, ‘it’s all image…’ (Market Design \nConsultant 3).   \n \nEchoing the literature, several respondents referred to the need for consistency in the \ncommunication of services brands’ values.  In terms of the values being \ncommunicated by the behaviour of organisational members, the brand values need \nto be ‘permeated through all the levels of the organisation’ (Market Research \nConsultant 1) so that consumers get a consistent experience.  In terms of the brand’s \nexternal communications, there needs to be consistency between the various \nchannels – one respondent’s comment about less successful services brands was \nthat, ‘they will send out fantastic advertising messages which lead you to believe a \ncertain set of things about the brand and then they will completely screw it up by \ndoing … direct mail activity which is ill-targeted, badly written, inconsistent with the \nbrand values and only designed to pull response’ (Market Research Consultant 2).   \n \n 7\nDiscussion and Managerial Implications \n \nOur research has led us to believe that the values of a services brand are \ncommunicated to the majority of consumers holistically, through their experience of \nthe brand as a whole.  Every interface between the consumer and the brand needs to \nconsistently reinforce the brand’s values.  In line with the literature, the behaviour of \nemployees at the point of contact, brand communications such as advertising and PR \nand the tangible elements of the service offering all contribute to consumers’ \nperceptions of a services brand’s values.   \n \nStaff are initially made aware of services brands’ values via the HR function, \nincluding recruitment, induction and training (as indicated in the literature).  \nTherefore, as guardians of services brands’ values, it is vital that HR employees have \na comprehensive understanding of the brand and this guides their tactics.  Direct \ninternal and external brand communications also contribute to organisational \nsocialisation, as do the examples set by role-models, in the form of senior members \nof staff.   \n \nFor the communication to be effective there must be some element of interactivity – \nemployees will not internalise values simply by being told what they should think and \nfeel.  Also, care should be taken that the values are clarified for employees, as a \n‘Chinese whispers’ scenario can cloud the desired values, thus defeating the aim of \nstrengthening the culture of the services brand.  Importantly, any truly interactive \ncommunication of values to employees would include a feedback loop – at this point, \nthe values of the organisation become both self-sustaining and evolutionary.   \n \nConclusions \n \nThe effective communication of values to both consumers and employees is critical in \nthe success of services brands.  Consumers do not perceive the various elements of \nthe brand in isolation; rather, they combine synergistically resulting in an overall \nbrand image.  However, the dominant impact on the perception of services brands is \nthe interaction with employees at the point of service. Given this, a priority for service \norganisations is the interactive communication of values to employees, and thus to \nconsumers, if they are to compete in an increasingly competitive market.   \n \nReferences \n \nBegley, T.M. & Boyd D.P.

This work is based upon a literature review and themes highlighted from depth interviews with leading edge services branding consultants.  Values tend to be communicated to consumers via their experience of the brand as a whole, including their interactions with employees, external brand communications and the tangible elements of the service offering.  For employees, values are communicated via HR practices and polices, internal and external brand communications and the example set by senior managers.</dc:description><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>http://oro.open.ac.uk/1286/1/servicesbrands.pdf</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:source>Academy of Marketing Conference</dc:source><dc:title>Services brands' values: internal and external corporate communication</dc:title><rioxxterms:author>de Chernatony, Leslie</rioxxterms:author><rioxxterms:author>Drury, Susan</rioxxterms:author><rioxxterms:author>Segal-Horn, Susan</rioxxterms:author><rioxxterms:publication_date>2004-02</rioxxterms:publication_date><rioxxterms:type>Conference Paper/Proceeding/Abstract</rioxxterms:type><rioxxterms:version>AM</rioxxterms:version></rioxx></metadata></record>",
