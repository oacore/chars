Supported by the Centre for Literacy in Primary \nEducation, the teachers looked at how children’s work in these creative arts \npositively impacted on their language and literacy learning. Teachers described \ntheir classroom projects in Animating Literacy: inspiring children’s learning \nthrough teacher and artist partnerships (Ellis & Safford 2005). \n \nParallel to and building upon the teachers’ action research a CLPE research \nteam examined children’s work in these and other ‘creative partnership’ \nclassrooms for an additional term (to the end of 2004). CLPE widened the study \nto include additional schools, teachers, arts partners and children.  \n \nThis wider study, Creativity and literacy: many routes to meaning, analyses \nand compares processes, practices and roles across a range of creative projects \nand how all of these influence children’s language and literacy learning. The \nfindings presented here are based on CLPE’s classroom observations, field \nnotes, transcripts of children’s talk, children’s individual and collaborative \nmultimodal texts, interviews with children, teachers, headteachers and artists, \nand teachers’ notes and records. \n \nThis research was commissioned and supported by Creative Partnerships London \nSouth and CfBT Brixton-North Lambeth.     \n \n  \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n3 \n \n \n  \nCreativity and literacy: many routes to meaning \nChildren’s language and literacy learning in creative arts work  \n \nAcknowledgements   \n \nPart One: Creative arts partnerships in schools \n \n1) Introduction: looking for creativity……………………………………………………7 \n \n2) Research overview……………………………………………………………………………..22 \n \n3) Models of working, professional roles and practice………………………….28 \n \n4) Class studies in creative arts projects……………………………………………….56 \n \nPart 2: Children’s language and literacy in creative arts work \n \n5) Talk…………………………………………………………………………………………………… 116 \n \n6) Writing and multimodal texts…………………………………………………………..130 \n \n7) The power of story and literature…………………………………………………….145 \n \n8) Children’s responses and evaluations……………………………………………….159 \n \n9) Issues in assessment and progression………………………………………………..173 \n \n10) Findings and conclusions…………………………………………………………………….189 \n \nAppendices…………………………………………………………………………………………………….201 \n \nBibliography…………………………………………………………………………………………………..213 \n \n  \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n4 \nWe would like to thank our colleagues for their advice and support  \nThe Steering Committee \nHenrietta Dombey, University of Brighton \nSue Ellis, Centre for Literacy in Primary Education \nAnton Franks, Institute of Education \nMargaret Meek Spencer, Institute of Education  \nGemma Moss, Institute of Education \nSusanna Steele, University of Greenwich \n \n         Sarah Horrocks and Julia Lawrence \n         CfBT Brixton – North Lambeth \n \n         Mark Robertson and Rehana Mughal \n         Creative Partnerships London South \nand  \n        Pascaline Scalone, King’s College, University of London \n \nMany thanks to the teachers and headteachers… \nGill Dove, Karen Fowler \nMichael Faraday Primary School, Southwark \n  \nKerry Rowett, Sue Alton \nDeptford Park Primary School, Lewisham \n \nBrita Little, Anne Bailey, Deborah Hardy \nTriangle Nursery, Lambeth \n \nAdam Hickman, Liz Miller, Ros Lines \nJohanna Primary School, Lambeth \n \nAnne Orange, Steve Williamson \nSt. Stephen’s C of E Primary School, Lambeth \n \nClaire Majumdar, Sophie Parker, Alice Roth, Sue Scarsbrook \nSudbourne Primary School, Lambeth \n \nMegan King, Graham Jameson \nEdmund Waller Primary School, Lewisham \n  \nJim Hoyle, Val Hughes \nSandhurst Junior School, Lewisham \n  \nPat Boyer, Ruth Moyler, Cathie Jones \nDog Kennel Hill Primary School, Southwark \n  \nJulie Asquith, David Butler, Julia Reader \nGallion’s Mount Primary School, Greenwich \n \nand to the arts partners \nNicky Bashall, Hi8us South \nSusanna Steele, University of Greenwich \nTony Minion, Cloth of Gold \nGill Acham and Lucy Moelwyn-Hughes, The Place \nEmma Derrick, Studio Voltaire and Camberwell College of the Arts \nGillian Arnold \nJan Blake, Sasha Hoare, Ann Johnson, Nina Ayres, and Shan McLennan, the Royal Festival Hall \nRandy Klein \nRosemary Bignall \nThe English National Opera \nClaire Newby and Sue Emmas, The Young Vic Theatre \n \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n5 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n…and many thanks to the children who shared their ideas and insights \nabout their work in creative arts projects and their work in literacy \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n6 \n \n \n \n \nPart One \n \nCreative arts partnerships in schools \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n7 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   Chapter 1 \n \n   Introduction \n \n \n \n  ‘We’re looking for creativity now.’ \n  (Ofsted inspector’s comment)\n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n8 \nTwo strands of research  \nThis research looks at children’s work in schools which took part in a project \nentitled Animating Literacy, commissioned by Creative Partnerships London \nSouth and CfBT Action Zone – Brixton & North Lambeth. The schools’ aim was \nto generate creative teaching in literacy through engagement in arts activities, \nin collaboration with arts partners. Animating Literacy began with a hypothesis \nthat literacy and work in the creative arts are connected, and that work in the \ncreative arts can stimulate literacy. Teachers’ classroom-based projects, \npublished as individual accounts (Ellis & Safford 2005), formed the first strand \nof research.  \n \nCreativity and literacy: many routes to meaning forms the second strand of \nresearch and seeks to explore that hypothesis more fully, through a cross-site \nstudy of Animating Literacy schools and of additional schools involved in \ncreative partnerships. This research draws on the teachers’ classroom-based \nresearch and on evidence collected by an independent research team.  \n \nThe Animating Literacy project was one of many national and local \nprogrammes to promote creative approaches to learning through collaborative \nprojects undertaken with arts partners, and other partners with creative skills. \nCreative Partnerships is funded by the Department of Culture, Media and Sport, \nand administered by Arts Council England. But why do such projects arise at \nthis point in history, and what is the background to the new emphasis on \ncreativity in education? \n \nCreativity – why now? \nIn the late 1990s there was a resurgence of interest in the topic of creativity in \neducation. Although the New Labour government (which came to power in \n1997) continued many of the educational policies and programmes of its \nConservative predecessor, there was an interest at the highest level of \ngovernment in the idea of educating for an economy of the future, which would \nbe very different from that of the past.  \n \nSoon after coming to power, the government was approached by a small group \nof people who were seriously concerned at the lack of a focus on creativity in \nthe education system and who proposed an investigation into the opportunities \nfor promoting creativity in education. This group became the nucleus of the \nNational Advisory Committee on Creative and Cultural Education, which was \nestablished early in 1998. The NACCCE was set up jointly by the DfES and the \nDCMS with a brief to make recommendations to the Secretaries of State on \npromoting the creative and cultural development of young people through \nformal and informal education. Its report, All Our Futures: Creativity, Culture \nand Education appeared in 1999.  \n \nDuring the same period, considerable discussion was going on about the \ncultural changes that would be needed in the UK in the light of increasingly \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n9 \nrapid economic and technological change.  Seltzer and Bentley’s influential \nbook, The Creative Age: Knowledge and Skills for the New Economy (Demos \n1999) was a key text. These authors viewed education as a means of changing \nthe culture in ways which would help the transition to a ‘weightless economy’, \nin which service industries and e-commerce would be as important as \ntraditional manufacturing had been. The central challenge they saw for the \neducation system was to: \n \n‘find ways of embedding learning in a range of meaningful contexts, where \nstudents can use their knowledge and skills creatively to make an impact on \nthe world around them.’ \n \nAn interest in the idea of creativity was not particular to the UK. A number of \nother countries were also realising the importance of developing creativity in \nthe curriculum. This new emphasis arose from the perception that creativity \nwould be integral to future economic progress. Japan introduced creativity as a \nmajor curriculum component in 1995; the move came about in recognition of \nthe need for the country to respond to social and economic change.  \n \nCreativity in business  \nIn 1999 Alan Greenspan, chairman of the US Federal Reserve Board, said in an \naddress at Harvard: \n \n ‘Viewing a great painting or listening to a profoundly moving piano \nconcerto produces a sense of intellectual joy that is satisfying in and of \nitself. But arguably it also enhances and reinforces the conceptual \nprocesses so essential to innovation….The broader the context that an \ninquiring mind brings to a problem, the greater will be the potential for \ncreative insights that, in the end, contribute to a more productive \neconomy.’ \n \nGreenspan’s words echo a persistent theme in the creativity literature, or at \nleast that part of it which has focused on the importance of creativity for the \neconomy. Business creativity, or ‘corporate creativity’ is now a flourishing \narea, and there is a small industry in training for creativity, with workshops and \ncourses all over the world inducting business people into using their brains \nmore imaginatively.  \n \nCreativity in this sphere is viewed primarily as innovation. One adman-turned \ncreativity-expert who specialises in creativity training on a global scale \nexplains the essential thinking behind business creativity: \n \n \n ‘There’s a huge misconception about creativity. In any endeavour there \nare tremendously talented people who aren’t creative – people who can \nsing someone else’s songs really well or do a totally beautiful painting \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n10 \nbut who don’t necessarily bring in new ideas. Creativity is bringing new \nideas…A spreadsheet can do linear thought and come up with a \nconclusion but it can’t use its imagination. Ironically the Information \nAge is devaluing information, because everybody has it….it’s really not \nknowledge that’s powerful, it’s imagination. Seventy years ago Einstein \ntold us that imagination is more important than knowledge, and it’s \nespecially true today.’(Monahan 1999) \n \nTeresa Amabile, the Professor of Business Administration at Harvard Business \nSchool, has spent all her professional life in the study of creativity. She sees \ncreativity as one of the driving forces of human progress and considers that \n‘pushing the frontiers forward’ always involves significant human creativity. \nAmabile’s core hypothesis (1988) is that creativity is the product of intrinsic \nmotivation, and she has studied the conditions under which people work most \ncreatively. \n \n‘The fact is, almost all of the research in this field shows that anyone \nwith normal intelligence is capable of doing some degree of creative \nwork….Over the past five years, organizations have paid more attention \nto creativity and innovation than at any other time in my career. But I \nbelieve most people aren't anywhere near to realizing their creative \npotential, in part because they're laboring in environments that impede \nintrinsic motivation.’  \n \nThese ideas have strongly influenced thinking about how to develop a modern \nworkforce and have helped to bring about the beginnings of a change in the \ngovernment’s educational policy. Ken Robinson, the chair of the NACCCE, \nrecognised this when he observed \n \nThe interest in creativity stems partly from the fact that all \ngovernments  are concerned with the need to develop more flexible \nworkforces. They want people who can innovate and adapt to changing \ncircumstances. They know creativity is important but, on the whole, \nfew of them really know what it is or how to promote it. (All Our \nFutures) \n \nAll Our Futures \nWhen the NACCCE report appeared, it argued that a national strategy for \ncreative and cultural education was essential to unlock the potential of every \nyoung person in order for them to have the opportunity to contribute to the \ncountry's economic prosperity and social cohesion. All young people, it \nsuggested, could be creative to a lesser or greater degree if given the \nopportunity; it proposed a democratic view of creativity rather than a view of \ncreativity as the possession of an elite. It called for ‘teaching for creativity’ – \n‘forms of teaching that are intended to develop young people’s own creative \nthinking and behaviour.’  \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n11 \n \nAmong the report’s recommendations were:  \n• that there should be a better balance between subjects in the National \nCurriculum, with less emphasis on core subjects at the expense of \nfoundation subjects;  \n• that the content of the curriculum should be reduced in order to make way \nfor more creative approaches to teaching and learning; \n• that there should be a broader debate on the structure of the curriculum. \nArguing that the NC had its origins in a subject-based model of the \ncurriculum which had not evolved greatly since the 19th century, the report \ncalled for a readiness to look again at the basic assumptions behind the \ncurriculum.  \n \nAll our Futures was positively received in many quarters, but the government \ndid not send out copies of the report, or even a summary, to schools nationally. \nThe DfEE and the DCMS issued a joint response to the report more than six \nmonths after its publication, in January 2000.  This response did not take up \nmany of the points in the report, but did indicate that the QCA would be asked \nto do further work on the role of creativity and the arts in the curriculum. It \nalso announced that ‘creative development’ would be a curriculum area in the \nfoundation stage curriculum.  \n \nMathilda Marie Joubert, who was the research officer to the NACCCE, suggests \nthat one reason for this low-key response was the very term ‘creativity’, which \nperhaps carried too many associations with old-style ‘progressive education’ for \na government still tightly focused on raising achievement. Creativity is \nnotoriously difficult to define. The NACCCE’s official definition (‘imaginative \nactivity fashioned so as to produce outcomes which are both original and of \nvalue’) lacks communicative spark; a better definition might be another \nformulation that is also to be found in the report: ‘applied imagination’ \n(Joubert 2001).   \n \nAnother obstacle to the report being immediately taken up might have been its \nlong-term agenda and visionary character. The report’s recommendations were \na long way from the prevailing education climate, where short-term goals and \nmeasurable targets had become the norm. And, perhaps most importantly of \nall, the report appeared at a time when the top-down National Literacy and \nNumeracy Strategies still exemplified the government’s main approach to \npromoting change in education. These strategies, with their standardised and \nscripted approaches to pedagogy were very different from the approach taken \nin the report, which stressed that teaching for creativity cannot be achieved \nwithout creative teaching.  \n \n \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n12 \nPolicy developments since the NACCCE report \nIn 2000, the review of the National Curriculum emphasised creativity as an \nimportant aim. The Secretary of State for Education and Skills asked QCA to \nfollow up this review by investigating how schools can promote pupils' \ncreativity through the national curriculum. During the first year of this \ninvestigation, QCA looked at how other countries were promoting creativity. \nThe review they commissioned examined the policies and curriculum \nrequirements of nineteen countries, and analysed a wide range of literature \nand research findings. It found a general recognition among these countries \nthat creativity was important and that the development of creativity needed to \nbe more generally encouraged. The arts were seen as providing a particularly \nimportant contribution to creativity and cultural development. Recognition of \nthe importance of creativity was growing under pressure of the global \neconomic situation and the perceived need for innovation and change in a \nclimate of increasing competitiveness.   \n \nFollowing this review, QCA commissioned other reviews of creativity across the \ncurriculum, and went on to develop creative approaches to teaching and \nlearning with 120 teachers in England. This project set out:  \n \n‘to investigate how they could develop pupils' creativity through their \nexisting schemes of work and lesson plans.’ \n \nSeveral of the outcomes from this project are to be found on the QCA website, \nNational Curiculum in Action, in the section called Creativity, Find it, Promote \nit (2003). This publication from QCA is part of a three-year curriculum project \ndesigned to advise schools on how to develop pupils’ creativity.  \n \nThe QCA creativity framework that informs this work defines creativity as \ninvolving pupils in:  \n• Questioning and challenging \n• Making connections, seeing relationships \n• Envisaging what might be \n• Exploring ideas, keeping options open \n• Reflecting critically on ideas, actions, outcomes. \n \nThis is a framework which is more closely aligned with work on teaching \nthinking and problem-solving than on work in the creative arts. There is a \nconstant tension in discussions of creativity between a desire to broaden out \ncreativity so that it includes the whole curriculum, and a recognition that \ncreativity and the arts are closely allied.  \n \nOther moves from QCA included a research review of Creativity in Education \ncarried out by Anna Craft in 2001, and Creativity across the curriculum, a \nreport prepared for QCA by Marilyn Fryer (2003). This report was focused on \nthe ‘teaching thinking’ aspect of creativity and was based on a small-scale \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n13 \ninvestigation into some programmes designed to develop creativity in the USA, \nJapan and other countries. \n \n‘Culture and Creativity’ and ‘Excellence and Enjoyment’ \nIn the meantime, in 2001 the Department of Culture and Media and Sport \npublished a green paper entitled Culture and Creativity: the next ten years. \nThis paper announced the setting up of the Creative Partnerships scheme. The \nDCMS paper puts a central emphasis on education, and on the need to ensure \nthat children in deprived areas are given the opportunity to develop creativity \nin learning and participate in cultural activities. Creative Partnerships, an \norganisation based at Arts Council England, set out to develop long-term \npartnerships between schools and cultural and creative organisations, including \ntheatre companies, museums, orchestras, website designers and many others.  \n \nIn May 2003 the DfES set out a vision for the future of primary education in a \nlandmark document entitled Excellence and Enjoyment: a strategy for primary \nschools. This vision, according to the DfES’s own summary, is ‘for the \nachievement of high standards through a rich, varied and exciting curriculum \nthat develops children in a range of ways’. The new ‘Primary Strategy’ marked \na departure from the top-down approach of the Literacy and Numeracy \nStrategies and was described as ‘moving on to offer teachers more control and \nflexibility’. This document encouraged schools and teachers to ‘take ownership \nof the curriculum…be creative and innovative’.   \n \nOn the heels of this report, Ofsted published ‘Expecting the Unexpected: \ndeveloping creativity in primary and secondary schools’(2003), the outcome of \na small-scale HMI survey to identify good practice in the promotion of creativity \nin schools. This helpful publication both identified some features of successful \npractice and noted some common barriers to the promotion of creativity in \nschools.  \n \nOther contributions to the constant stream of documents which have appeared \nin the wake of the NACCCE report have included the Arts Council England \ndrama curriculum (Drama in Schools 2003), and the RSA Competencies \nCurriculum (1999, 2003) which envisages a move away from separate academic \nsubjects in favour of integrated areas of learning. There have also been studies \ninto the effects of creativity such as an NFER research review on Developing \nYoung Children’s Creativity through the Arts (Sharp 2001) and an IPPR \ndiscussion paper on the Arts and Educational Inclusion (Lidstone 2003).  \n \nMixed Messages \nHowever, these explicit messages about the desirability of creative approaches \nto teaching and learning have been somewhat clouded by the fact that they are \nread by teachers against a background in which flexibility and risk-taking have \nbeen discouraged. Schools are subject to a heavy assessment regime that has \nonly recently begun to change (with the option of teacher assessment at Key \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n14 \nStage One), and the education system is still obsessed with targets and league \ntables. The DfES, in announcing the policy move represented by Excellence and \nEnjoyment, insisted on the ‘achievement of high standards’ as the main driving \nforce behind the encouragement of more exciting approaches to teaching and \nlearning. In much the same way, the QCA Creativity website, while urging \nteachers to: \n‘Capitalise on unexpected learning opportunities!’ \n \nglossed this as ‘actively pursuing pupils' ideas (where these are likely to be \nproductive), without losing sight of your original teaching objective’ (our \nemphasis). \n  \nThe difficulty QCA is labouring under is that creative approaches have to be \npromoted without essentially altering the structures that schools are working in \nand, most particularly, without letting up the pressure on schools to perform \never better in statutory assessments. This kind of ambiguity is described by \nRobin Alexander as ‘a desire to be seen to be offering freedom while in reality \nmaintaining control’ (Alexander 2003). It an ambiguity that could create \ntensions and difficulties in schools without a strong commitment to creative \nways of working, or a leadership which is prepared to take risks and allow \ninnovation and experiment.  \n \nProfessor Teresa Amabile’s work on creativity in business settings suggests that \nmany managerial practices kill creativity by crushing ‘intrinsic motivation’ and \npursuing ‘productivity, efficiency and control’. These observations have clear \nimplications for the stop/go approach to creativity in education.  In Expecting \nthe Unexpected, HMI noted that flexibility in timetabling and the opportunity \nto work at length and in some depth were important elements in successful \ncreative projects. Overly constraining curricular organisation was seen as a \nbarrier to progress. In some schools, the constraints of the original approach \nadopted by the literacy and numeracy strategies have left a legacy of rigidity \nand an unwillingness to let go of formulaic styles of teaching.  \n \nIt is not yet completely clear whether UK educational policy has really \nundergone a fundamental change of direction, or whether creativity is simply \nthe latest tactic in a continuing search for ways of pushing up pupils’ test \nscores. The perception that a ‘creativity steer’ is expected to contribute to \nimproved academic achievement is evidenced by QCA’s website, which \nexplicitly asserts that:  \n \n‘Creativity improves pupils’ self-esteem, motivation and achievement.’  \n \nIt is interesting that the QCA feels free to make this assertion, for which so \nlittle hard research evidence exists. But it is true that there is a mass of \ninformal evidence for this kind of association between pupils’ involvement in \ncreative learning, their increased confidence and self-esteem, and \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n15 \ndevelopments in their learning and achievement.  Schools do not embrace \ncreative approaches to teaching and learning solely for these reasons, but their \nperception that creative approaches have an impact on pupils’ engagement \nwith learning contributes to their commitment to creativity. \n \nIn general it is clear that most primary schools do welcome the new \n‘permission’ to work more creatively (although some have never stopped doing \nso) and are taking enthusiastic advantage of the extra funding available from \nCreative Partnerships to further these ends. HMI/Ofsted found that: \n \n ‘the vast majority of creative work in the 42 schools visited was at \nleast good, with around 20% exceptionally good. This generally high \nquality is likely to be sustained because teachers are committed to the \npromotion of creativity (and) have the active support of senior \nmanagement in this promotion...’(Expecting the Unexpected, 2003) \n \nResearch into creativity and learning \nHMI’s report takes a determinedly cross-curricular stance to their task of \nsurveying good practice in promoting creativity in schools. Their report takes in \nwork in history, art and design, performing, arts, English, dance, geography, \ndesign and technology, modern foreign languages, science and mathematics. \nThis broad picture of creativity in learning echoes the approach taken by the \nNACCCE report, which is at pains to stress that creativity should not be seen as \nthe sole preserve of the arts. The view of creativity taken in the NACCCE report \nis also a democratic view, the report speaks of ‘democratic creativity’. In \nadopting this term the committee were striving to detach ideas of creativity \nfrom its traditional associations with unusual artistry.  \n \nResearch about creativity, until relatively recently, tended to be concerned \nwith ‘high creativity’. Creativity has been associated with innate creative \ntalent, with paradigm-breaking and with exceptional originality of mind. \nHoward Gardner’s study of ‘high creativity’, for instance (Gardner 1993) \nfocuses entirely on the attributes of seven geniuses as revealed in their life \nhistories. But more recently, creativity studies have taken more interest in \ncreativity as an aspect of ordinary learning, and as being ‘situated’ in \nsupportive communities. \n \nAnna Craft (2001) has written about what she terms ‘little c creativity’ (LCC), \nas opposed to high creativity, and has argued that problem-solving and \nquestioning are part of a creative and innovative approach to ordinary life \nchallenges and to learning in any domain. She stresses the importance of \nopenness to possibility, or ‘possibility thinking’ in LCC, and outlines some of \nthe features of possibility thinking as being self-determination, innovation, \nquestioning, risk, imagination and play. Craft has been explicitly critical of the \ngovernment’s educational policy as expressed in the national strategies for \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n16 \nliteracy and numeracy. She views these strategies as being top-down \napproaches which have limited teachers’ ability to work creatively: \n \n‘To take an example from within primary education in England in 1999, \nthe current political context can be seen as one in which the artistry of \nteaching is being undermined by a technicist view of pedagogy’.  \n \nThe government’s move away from the literacy and numeracy strategies, and \ntowards a national primary strategy with an emphasis on ‘excellence and \nenjoyment’ may reflect a realisation that its earlier approach was becoming \ncounter-productive. \n \nDiscussions of creativity in education are increasingly concerned with ‘creative \ncommunities’, and with the kinds of organisational approaches that foster \ncreativity. Jenny Leach (2001), through her work in the Centre for Research \nand Development in Teacher Education at the Open University, suggests that: \n \n ‘in settings where creativity is an aspect of the knowledge valued, and \nwhere creative processes become the subject of learning, teachers and \nlearners collectively share and develop goals, purposes and activities \nthat other commentators commonly ascribe to ‘creative’ individuals.’ \n \nShe and her colleagues at the Open University are interested in communities \nthat share creative goals and purposes, encourage joint participation in \ncreative projects, and jointly and individually create high quality products.  \n \nThe psychologist Vera John-Steiner (2000), in Creative Collaboration, suggests \nthat it is a myth to suppose that creative people create on their own; all \ncreative people need support and encouragement. Through her study of \ncomplex collaborations in the fields of science and the arts, John-Steiner \nillustrates that the mind – rather than thriving on solitude – is dependent upon \nhuman relationships. Guy Claxton (2004), of the University of Bristol, also \nstresses that encouragement and ‘critical support’ are features of some of the \nmost successful science laboratories. \n \nResearch into the creative arts and learning \nAs previously noted, current discussions of creativity in education do not give a \nspecial place to the creative arts but draw on examples of creative thinking in \nany sphere. The avowed policy of Creative Partnerships is to put schools in \ntouch with creative practitioners from a wide range of organisations, not only \nin the arts. In practice, however, schools involved in the scheme have tended \nto seek partnerships with arts organisations, and to see the scheme as a way of \ngiving children access to high quality experiences in art, design, drama, dance, \nand music.    \n \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n17 \nThe Animating Literacy project in the Creative Partnerships London South \nregion arose from an expressed desire, among the schools represented on the \nsteering committee, to develop a more creative approach to literacy teaching \nand learning, which they believed could come from a stronger emphasis on, \nand association with, the arts. A central question that this research therefore \nset out to answer was whether children’s involvement in creative arts activities \nactually did have an impact on their school work in literacy.  \n \nThere is already abundant anecdotal evidence of the positive effects of work in \ndrama or in art on children’s literacy development. Lynda Graham’s accounts \nof the work done by Croydon teacher researchers on literacy development, as \npart of the Croydon Reading and Writing Projects, have suggested that creative \nand imaginative work can have a powerfully positive effect on children’s \nprogress. For instance, Croydon Reading Project teachers found that \n‘performance reading’ assumed particular importance for reluctant boy \nreaders, who began to enjoy books when they were involved in group reading \nof texts aloud for an audience. In the Croydon Writing Project, one cohort of \nteachers (Graham 2002) decided to integrate writing with such creative \nactivities as imaginative play, storytelling, drama, drawing and visualisation; \nthese ‘world-making’ activities kindled enthusiasm and interest in previously \nuninvolved pupils, who made significant progress in writing. Graham concludes: \n \n‘In the second year of the Writing Project, teachers themselves began to \nmake and enter imagined worlds with their children. This then made it \npossible for children themselves to begin to create their own imagined \nworlds, through writing.’ \n \nOther publications which have documented successful outcomes of children’s \nwork in creative arts, with evidence of enhanced language and literacy \nperformance related to this work, include Southwark Arts Council’s Leave Your \nMark Before You Go (Deveson 2003) and the Tate Modern’s Visual Paths to \nLiteracy (Tate Publications 2000). \n \nLarger scale studies in this field have included the work of the Creative Arts \nEducation Partnership in the USA, which has issued an important report on the \nimpact of the creative arts on learning (Fiske 1999). The report includes \naccounts of seven major studies that together provided evidence of enhanced \nlearning and achievement when students are involved in a variety of creative \narts experience. The conclusions from these studies are that the creative arts \nchange the learning environment and the learning experience for students, \nproviding opportunities for ‘creation’ rather than ‘recreation’. One of these \nprojects, Shirley Brice Heath’s research on after-school programmes, concluded \nthat the creative arts reach students who are not otherwise being reached.  \n \nSimilarly, in the UK, work by Harland et al. (2000) on the effects and \neffectiveness of secondary school creative arts education in England and Wales \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n18 \nfound a wide range of benefits to individuals. These ranged from the \ndevelopment of creativity and thinking skills to enhanced knowledge of social \nand cultural issues.  \n \nShirley Brice Heath’s more recent work for Creative Partnerships in Hythe \nCommunity School in Kent (2004), has found marked linguistic gains in infant \nschool children taking part in a Creative Partnership project in visual learning. \nWorking with artist Roy Smith, these KS1 children gained experience of drawing \nfrom close observation rather than from memory. Brice-Heath comments that: \n \n‘His (Roy Smith’s) talk is marked by visual vocabulary, which calls the \nchildren to see comparable shapes.’ \n \nShe gives an example of Roy Smith’s commentary on children as they draw: \n \n ‘Look at your shading, that’s fantastic! Art is all about looking. About \nlooking very closely. If you can see it, then you can draw it.’ \n \nThrough collecting audio recordings of children and the artist at work, and \nanalysis of patterns of language, Brice Heath and her research associate studied \nthe effect of this attention to detail in drawing on children’s talk. They found \nthat working with the visual artist was involving children in the kind of \nextended discourse associated with linguistic and conceptual development. At \na more technical linguistic level, Brice Heath found examples of an increase in \nembedded clauses and conditional tenses in the children’s language, suggestive \nof more complex and tentative thinking. \n \nCan the arts contribute to academic achievement? \nDespite a widespread conviction that skills and attitudes learned through the \narts can help children in academic learning, there have been few large-scale \nstudies that have identified positive effects on school achievement (in literacy \nor other curriculum areas) as a consequence of students’ involvement in the \ncreative arts. An exhaustive research review carried out in a special issue of \nthe Journal of Aesthetic Education (Winner and Hetland 2000) found no \nconclusive evidence for effect of arts work on students’ test scores, except in \none or two areas. The Journal editors, while reporting that a positive \nrelationship between studying the arts and academic achievement does exist, \nstress that this positive correlation does not imply a causal relationship \nbetween arts study and academic achievement.  \n \nThe contributors to the special issue of the Journal arrive at their findings \nthrough the detailed analysis of existing research in the fields of visual arts, \nmusic, drama and dance and their relationship to academic learning. Drawing \non both correlational studies and experimental studies, they seek to establish \nwhether there is hard evidence for claims that exposure to the arts leads to \ncognitive growth or enhanced academic achievement. In only one area do they \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n19 \nfind strong evidence of a link between the arts and enhanced achievement, and \nthis is in drama, where the review of available research finds that: \n \n‘drama is an effective tool for increasing achievement in story \nunderstanding, reading achievement, reading readiness and writing.’ \n \nThis study of drama finds that drama teaching is particularly effective for \nchildren of lower achieving and economically disadvantaged children. It also \nnotes that, in some areas (eg story understanding) a stronger effect on \nchildren’s achievement is visible when the drama teaching involves teachers \nworking in role. \n \nThe intrinsic difficulties of looking at the benefits of the arts through the lens \nof this kind of research are apparent throughout this issue of the Journal.  Many \nresearch studies showing positive outcomes in children’s learning are found to \nbe inconclusive in the light of the strict criteria applied by the Journal’s \nreviewers. Several of the chapters point to positive correlations between arts \nprogrammes and academic achievement, but these are not regarded as \nsignificant since ‘correlational studies allow no conclusions about causality’ \n(p.174). For instance, the chapter on visual art and reading finds that the \nteaching of reading in association with a visual arts programme can lead to \nimprovements in reading. But the discussion of these findings argues that, \nwhile children may be motivated through such programmes, this in itself is not \nevidence of a link between arts education and reading progress. \n \nAnother problem with the criteria employed is that the Journal’s reviewers \ntend to dismiss as unreliable any studies that could be influenced by ‘teacher \nexpectancy effects’. To be completely reliable, in their terms, research should \nbe strictly experimental. That is, there should be matching control groups, and \nteachers should be unaware of the hypotheses being assessed. The difficulties \nof achieving these kinds of experimental conditions in a human setting are \napparent. Given the inflexible and narrow nature of the criteria, it is actually \nquite surprising to find that the majority  of chapters in this landmark issue of \nthe Journal find some evidence of a positive relationship between the study of \nthe arts and academic achievement, even though in most cases this \nrelationship is correlational rather than causal. \n \nEthnographic research is given no place in this strictly experiment-led \nquantitative approach to research. Yet, in noting that many schools claim that \nstudents learn better when the arts have a central role in their curriculum, the \nJournal’s editors comment that these claims should not be discounted. Instead \nthey think it would be important to ‘look closely and ethnographically’ at what \nhappens in these situations. It suggests that this kind of enquiry that could \nreveal more about how the creative arts interact with and transfer to other \nkinds of learning. The editors also note that most of the research reviewed in \nthis special issue of the Journal is concerned with ‘products’, usually in the \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n20 \nshape of test scores, and not with ‘process’.  They call for more studies of what \nhappens in schools and classrooms where the arts are given a central role, and \nfor evidence of the positive affective outcomes that this kind of emphasis may \nhave for students and teachers, to the consequent benefit of teaching and \nlearning.  \n \nAnalysing Animating Literacy \nOur research aimed to work in this way across ten classrooms involved in \ncreative arts partnership projects. Through a careful study of the outcomes of \nteachers’ own action research projects, and through independent observation, \nwe hoped to identify the success factors in those classrooms where work in the \narts had clearly led to positive developments in children’s language and \nliteracy learning.  \n \nWe drew extensively on teachers’ and artist partners’ own accounts of the \nwork that they engaged in. The outcomes of some, though not all, of these \nindividual classroom-based research projects provided convincing evidence of \ndevelopments in children’s progress as a consequence of their involvement in \ncreative arts projects. Teachers observed: \n \n ‘In terms of writing, the whole experience of storytelling gave children \nan inner voice to express and motivation to express it. Even in the final \nweeks of the summer term, one or two children made sudden bursts of \nprogress as the elements of listening, thinking and speaking blossomed \ninto writing.’(Year 2 teacher) \n \n‘I used three [different assessment] frameworks to assess the children’s \nprogress at the end of the project. Over 70% of the children moved on \nmore than 2 or 3 National Curriculum levels. Over 90% of the children \nnow had a consistently positive attitude to writing….The children were \nmore confident writers, they were asking questions about each other’s \nwork as well as giving their own opinions.’ (Year 6 teacher) \n \nIt was clear that for the most part the teachers involved in this project saw a \npositive value for children’s academic learning in these arts projects, as well as \nconsidering them to be important and stimulating educational experiences for \nchildren in their own right. They also emphasised affective outcomes: \nenjoyment and involvement in learning, enhanced confidence, increased \nmutual respect and greater commitment to school work. \n \nWorking closely with these teacher researchers, we interrogated their \nobservations and their documentation of children’s learning, and interviewed \nthem about their experience of the projects. We interviewed arts partners to \ngain their perspective on the collaborative processes that form the basis of \ncreative partnerships. We observed in classrooms and collected examples of \nchildren’s talk and writing. We interviewed children to gain their impressions \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n21 \nof the new learning experiences that they were being introduced to, and \ngathered their own evaluations of their progress.  \n \nOur approach throughout is narrative and descriptive, drawing on observations, \nfield notes, interviews, transcripts and analyses of children’s talk, writing, and \nmultimodal texts. Through these windows, we have tried to look at the \ninteractions that go on when teachers, arts partners and children come \ntogether in classrooms to engage in creative projects, and how the creativity of \neach of these partners is involved in the process of learning.  \n \n \n \n \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n22 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n         Chapter 2 \n \n \n   Research overview  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIt’s a new way of looking at learning… It’s about freeing up children’s \nideas of what is ‘good’.  Drawing, like other work with arts partners, is \none of those things in the curriculum that isn’t right or wrong.  \n(Teacher RM) \n \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n23 \n \nStarting points: teacher action research \nAnimating Literacy initially involved 12 teachers from six primary schools and \none nursery school where children worked with ‘arts partners’: dancers, \nfilmmakers, storytellers, actors, visual artists and other creative arts \nprofessionals. Teachers and arts partners described their projects in Animating \nLiteracy: inspiring children’s learning through teacher and artist partnerships \n(Ellis & Safford 2005).  \n \nAnimating Literacy teachers had no common frameworks for looking at \nchildren’s learning experiences and outcomes in these projects. Teachers’ data \ncollection varied widely; they used both formal and informal methods. For \nexample, nursery teachers tracked children’s progress using the Foundation \nStage Early Learning Goals. As a result of their creative project, the Nursery \nteachers also developed a school policy on how artists could work most \neffectively with young children (Appendix 1). Five teachers kept informal notes \nand observations, and in one school these were part of normal school routines \nfor record-keeping. Two teachers tracked children’s progress using non-\nstatutory frameworks developed by CLPE (Appendices 2 and 2a).  Two teachers \ntracked children’s progress using statutory assessment frameworks and \nattainment targets for writing (Appendix 3). One group of teachers evaluated \ntheir working relationship with arts partners rather than tracking children’s \nlearning.     \n \nWidening the study \nThis cross-school research, The Imagined World, examines common themes and \noutcomes of children’s language and literacy development in creative arts \nprojects on a wider scale. Paralleling and building on the Animating Literacy \nteachers’ action research, this cross-site study added an additional three \nprimary schools and six teachers involved in creative arts projects, to make a \nstudy involving ten schools and 18 teachers. The research continued for a \nfourth school term and included an additional 60 observations and in-depth \ninterviews with 15 teachers, 3 head teachers, 10 creative arts practitioners and \n36 children from Nursery to Year Six (Appendix 4).   \n \nThe backgrounds of authors of this report are in primary English, literacy \npedagogy and practice, and classroom research. Whilst primarily examining the \nimpact of work in creative projects on children’ language and literacy learning, \nwe have also, inevitably, examined the teacher perspective on ‘creative \npartnerships’. We have, however, tried also to ensure that we fairly reflected \nissues of concern to creative arts practitioners working in schools.   \n \nResearch aims  \nThis research aimed to investigate how children’s work in creative arts \ninfluenced their work in literacy through observation of creative arts projects \nin action and analysis of children’s responses and outcomes. By looking closely \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n24 \nat aims, activities and outcomes of creative arts projects, we looked for \ncommon themes, patterns and practices that could be generalisable for literacy \nteaching and learning. Our research questions included: \n \n• How does children’s work in the creative arts influence their language and \nliteracy development? Are there underlying patterns across creative arts \nforms?  \n• What are favourable contexts and effective processes for children’s \nlanguage and literacy development in creative arts projects in schools?  \n• What is appropriate assessment of children’s work in the creative arts? \n \nTen schools \nThe ten school-based creative arts projects were diverse in nature. Most of the \nprojects were funded for three terms. Two creative projects were part of \nwhole-school development plans; two projects existed in isolation from the \nschool curriculum. Six projects were guided by aims (eg to help children tell \ntheir stories through the medium of film), four were guided by questions or \ninquiries (eg can dance improve children’s writing skills?). Three projects were \nsupported by an experienced arts education team from the local education \nauthority.  \n \nChildren from Nursery to Year 6 were involved. Teachers ranged from the \nnewly-qualified to classroom veterans with over 20 years’ experience. Arts \npartners ranged from lone individuals, to small organisations and major \nnational cultural centres.  There were no ethnic minority teachers and three \nethnic minority arts partners. Project schools were all in inner London. Ethnic \nminority and bilingual children were the majorities in project classrooms. One \nschool’s intake included one hundred and eleven asylum seeker children. In \nseven of the project schools over half of the children were entitled to free \nschool meals. In all the schools there were substantial numbers of children \nidentified as having special educational needs.  \n  \nData collection \nTo discover how creative arts projects influenced children’s language and \nliteracy learning, we took an ‘ethnographic’, holistic approach which was \nnarrative and descriptive. We adopted a ‘quadrangular’ perspective to take \ninto account the viewpoints of child, teacher, arts partner and researcher. \nParticipants often had multiple roles: teachers were researchers, artists were \nteachers, children were apprentice-artists and researchers were participant-\nobservers.    \n       \nWe drew our conclusions from a careful study of the outcomes of teachers’ \naction research and from our independent inquiry into their projects and \nothers. Working closely with teachers, we interrogated their observations and \ntheir documentation of children’s learning. We interviewed arts partners to \ngain their perspective on the collaborative processes of school-based ‘creative \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n25 \npartnerships’. Teachers and arts partners also had extensive, informal \ndiscussions with the research officer throughout and after the projects. We \ninterviewed children to gain their impressions of the new learning experiences \nto which they were being introduced by these creative arts projects, and to \ngather their own evaluations of their progress. (appendix 4). Children were \ninterviewed towards or at the end of their projects. In one school, children \nwere interviewed nearly a year after working with the arts partner (yet their \nrecall was as vivid as if they had done the work yesterday).    \n \nA CLPE research officer visited classrooms weekly for observations, interviews \nand recording or collecting children’s work. Class work was observed once a \nweek, or whenever the arts partner was in the class (Appendix 5). Observations \nexamined how work in creative arts projects was organised and carried out, \nhow children worked in these activities and responded to their experiences in \ntalk and in writing.  \n \nWe examined how projects shaped patterns and processes of teaching and \nlearning. We examined outcomes in children’s creative arts work and in \nliteracy, and noted where and how these outcomes were connected.  The \nresearch portfolio included: \n \n• classroom activities and interaction in observational notes, photographs \nand video recordings  \n• resources and materials used in activities \n• analysis of a range of children’s writing and multimodal texts (Appendix \n6) \n• transcripts and analyses of children’s talk  \n• teachers’ notes and observations \n• general field notes, particular contextual observations and comments \n• audio and video Interviews with children, teachers and arts partners \n• children’s project outcomes and other work produced across activities \n \nThemes that strongly emerged in the data are analysed in subsequent chapters: \nhow work in the creative arts influenced individual children, the whole class \nand the teacher; different models and patterns of working; issues in \nprofessional practice and assessment; children’s responses as they worked and \nin reflection; the roles of talk, story and literature in children’s creative arts \nwork, and what types of assessment are appropriate for work of this nature.   \n \nOver four school terms this research examined and compared how creative arts \nprojects operated in individual classrooms. Observations, recorded interviews \nwith children, teachers and arts partners, children’s individual and \ncollaborative texts, children’s creative products and teachers’ notes during \ntheir action research all contributed to a 360-degree view of children’s work in \ncreative arts projects and how this work contributed to their language and \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n26 \nliteracy development. We drew conclusions from this wide-angle view and also \nfrom teachers’ case studies of individual children. This methodology helped us  \n \nto compare work and experiences across classrooms, how creative projects \ninfluenced groups as well as individuals. \n \nThe following chapters look closely at these classrooms and children’s language \nand literacy development in the context of their work in creative arts projects.  \n \n \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n27 \n \nSchool \nNumber on roll  \n \nClass or year groups, \nteachers and  \narts partners  \nProject and length of \ntime \nAim or inquiry \nPrimary School A \n591  \n \n \nYear 5 class \n \nTeacher KR \nFilmmaker NB \n3-terms of drama, film \nstudy and filmmaking \nculminating in the making \nof five short films  \nTo help children tell their \nstories through the medium of \nfilm \nPrimary School B \n359  \nThree mixed 1-2 classes \n \nTeachers CM, SP & AR \nDancer GA \n3 terms of weekly dance \nlessons linked to National \nLiteracy Strategy \nobjectives \nCan dance improve Key Stage \n1 children’s writing skills? \nNursery School C Whole school (Foundation \nStage) \n \nTeachers AB & BL \nVisual artists ED, DA and \nLV  \n3 terms of drawing, \npainting and 3D modelling \nin a studio space near the \nNursery school \nDoes exposure to different art \nforms influence children’s \noral language development? \n \nPrimary School D \n189  \nYear 6 class \n \nTeacher AH \nTheatre Company Y \nOpera Company O \n \nStoryteller AJ, visual artist \nNA \n \n3-terms of learning about \ntheatre arts: watching, \nlistening, performing \n \n \n \n1 term storytelling and \nlinked visual art \ninstallation \nHow does exposure to theatre \narts help to develop \nchildren’s critical thinking \nskills? \n \n \nFor children to learn to \nbecome storytellers \n \nPrimary School E \n208  \nYear 2 class \n \n \nMixed Year 5-6 class \n \nTeacher AO \nStoryteller JB, Visual artist \nML \n3-terms  of storytelling \n \n \n1 term storytelling and \nart work \nCan oral storytelling improve \nchildren’s writing? \n \nTo use knowledge of stories to \ncreate 3-D models illustrating \ntraditional tales \n \nPrimary School F \n445   \nYear 5 class \n \nTeacher MK \nVisual artist TM \n1 ½ terms multimedia \nexplorations   \nTo inspire the reluctant writer \nthrough multi-sensory and \ncomputer workshops \nJunior School G \n300  \nYear 4 class \n \nTeacher JH \nTheatre P \n \n \n2-terms of interactive \nscript-writing \nFor children to learn to use an \ninteractive computer \nprogramme; to use this to \nfind out about another city \nand then to write and perform \na short script using knowledge \nabout that city \nPrimary school H \n344  \nYear 5 class \n \nTeacher GD \nDrama specialist SS \n1-term of drama \nexplorations of the \nthemes of a novel \nHow does a culturally \nrelevant text engage learners \nwith English as an additional \nlanguage? \nPrimary School  I \n472  \nWhole school \nVisual artist GT, dance \ncompany L, theatre \ncompany G, arts college C, \nstoryteller PP \n3 terms of  storytelling, \ndrawing and sculpture in \nKS1; dance, drama and \nperformance in KS2  \n \nTo develop a  whole-school, \ncross-curricular approach to \nlearning in the creative arts \nPrimary School J \n391 \nWhole school \nSculptor RB, visual artist \nRK \n3 terms of sketching , \ndrawing and sculpture \nTo develop a whole-school art \nproject that involves \nprogression of skills and \nunderstanding across age \nphases \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n28 \n \n    Chapter 3 \n \nModels of working, professional roles and practice \n \n \n \n \nArts partner dancer GA: I’ve seen some remarkable work, people sharing \nideas, having great ideas, practicing thoroughly – that’s what we call \nREHEARSING. \n \nLuke, Year 1: Like you do in sport \n \nGA: Yes, thank you, when you practice and practice you remember when \nyou perform it.

It was a relationship that \ninvolved showing and demonstrating rather than telling and explaining; working \nalongside children rather than monitoring their work. It was teaching that \ncreated what Connie Rosen (1973) called the ‘triangle’ where children and \nadults focused and worked together on a shared enterprise.  \nCreative projects generated a ‘workshop’ atmosphere in classrooms. There was \nan emphasis on activity, doing and making. There was little transmission \nteaching and more of an ‘atelier’ approach in which every child was working. \nChildren did not do differentiated work according to their abilities. Observers \nwere unable to distinguish children with Special Educational Needs from the \nrest of the class.   \nChildren’s work in creative projects was not target-driven. Yet it often involved \nextensive rehearsal and practice. Some projects had a clear goal: a \nperformance, an exhibition or a product finished to a high standard. Where \nchildren worked towards a performance or an exhibition – particularly in a \ncommunity space - they saw the purpose of practice, rehearsal and demanding \nstandards.  \n \nDonald Schön (1987:16) argues that learning forms of professional artistry \ndepends in part on creating conditions similar to those in studios and \nconservatories, where children have ‘freedom to learn by doing in a setting \nrelatively low in risk’. They learn with the help of professionals who ‘initiate’ \nthem into the traditions and working standards of a particular art form or \nprofession. According to Schön, ‘everything is practicum’ in creative arts \nlearning. Therefore children should be able to learn about sculpture, painting, \ndrawing, dance, drama or storytelling by making sculptures, paintings, \ndrawings, dances, plays or stories. However this way of working was not always \na straightforward proposition in classrooms. Teachers experienced difficulty in \nachieving and maintaining ‘practicum’, even where they had flexibility and \npolicy support to do so (eg Excellence and Enjoyment; Creativity Find It \nPromote It).  \nWhat constitutes ‘work’ in the classroom? \nChildren enjoyed the creative arts projects we observed in schools. Arts \nprojects were a vacation from routine. ‘It’s different from what we do \nnormally’ and ‘it’s not boring’ were often-heard comments from children.  \nCreative arts projects highlighted the role of pleasure in learning; at the same \ntime, they demanded attention and involvement from children.  \n \nAnimating Literacy teachers observed that for many children enjoyment in \ncreative arts work generated confidence, confidence led to engagement in \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n30 \nlearning, and this heightened engagement resulted in improvements in \nchildren’s reading, writing, speaking and listening. These improvements were \nsometimes, but not always, measurable as higher numbers in literacy test \nscores (see Chapter 9 on Issues in Assessment). Nevertheless teachers were \nconvinced that these gains were real and permanent.    \n   \nThrough the arts projects, they’re engaged in a really important aspect \nof school life, and we know that engagement has a knock on effect but \nnot necessarily as a number or a level in a test score... We know the \nskills the children have got as writers and readers will stand them in \ngood stead in their future education. It may not be acknowledged in the \nstatutory tests, but it is there, and it is real achievement.  \n(Headteacher PB) \n \nHowever, creative arts projects also raised questions about the nature of what \nconstitutes ‘work’ in the classroom. For artists ‘work’ was an exploration or a \nprocess, often without a pre-defined outcome. In other classrooms ‘work’ was \ntowards a specific performance or exhibition. But children and teachers often \nhad narrower ideas of ‘work’.  \nOut of the ten projects, only one teacher organised the arts partner to come to \nclass on Mondays, in order to start the week with the creative project and \ndevelop this work throughout the week. In six classrooms, teachers organised \narts partners to come on Thursdays, with some small amount of follow-up and \nfinishing-off on Fridays. In these classrooms, creative projects came after ‘real’ \nwork had been done. They were, in effect, a reward (or a kind of playtime) \nafter getting curriculum work out of the way. In three classrooms, arts partners \ncame into classes on a flexible timetable, arranged in agreement with the \nteacher.  \n \nIn School B, sessions with the arts partner replaced one Literacy Hour each \nweek. Teachers at this school strongly believed that unless the arts partner’s \ndance lessons were explicitly linked to weekly National Literacy Strategy \nobjectives, they would be ‘no different than a Saturday dance club’ which was \nnot a valid school learning experience. Because dance took the place of one \nLiteracy Hour in the weekly timetable, the missed literacy ‘work’ had to made \nup at other times in the week. Dance in itself was not seen as legitimate \n‘work’.   \n \nIn interviews, children believed that ‘work’ involved writing in books which \nwere then marked. Children leaving School A after a day of drama and \nwatching films commented, “We didn’t do any work today”. In school E, an \narts partner working with a group of Year 5/6 children had this exchange with \nthree boys:   \n \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n31 \nBoy 1: We’re special kids. Everyone else is doing work in class.  \nBoy 2: Are we staying here ‘til lunchtime? \nArts partner JB: What, you want to go back to class? \nBoy 2: Yeah. \nArtist: What, you want to go do literacy? \nBoy 3: Horrible literacy and numeracy with the horrible teacher who shouts \nat you? \n[All laugh] \nBoy 2 runs out of the classroom angrily. His teacher goes to talk to him. \nBoy 2 had just returned to school after a period of exclusion. He was anxious to \nbe seen to be doing ‘work’. For him, the creative project (storytelling and \nartwork illustrating traditional tales) did not constitute proper work. He \nwanted to do ‘literacy’, and storytelling and artwork were not ‘literacy’. Boy 1 \ndescribes the group as ‘special’ because they are not doing ‘work in class’. He \nalso knows that the group is ‘special’ because they constitute a ‘low-ability’ \nset of mainly Portuguese-speaking children who are in streamed ‘booster’ \nclasses for literacy. The storytelling and artwork project existed outside of \n‘class’ and therefore did not count as ‘work’.   \nSome creative arts projects began to challenge these attitudes. Arts partner SS, \na drama specialist in School H, made explicit to Year 5 children that ‘work’ was \na process in which children would experiment and gradually acquire \nknowledge, understanding and skills. These children had been writing \neloquently in the voice of a character, ‘Aysha’, from the class novel Lost for \nWords by Elizabeth Lutzeier.  Before writing, they had been exploring the \nstory-world through drama and role play, and this exploration was also the \nchildren’s ‘work’: \n \n[Your writing gets better] when you kept remembering back to the \nwork. When you remember back to the work, THAT’S where your ideas \nwill come from, because the ideas aren’t ‘up there’ [waving her hands \nin the air above her head], the ideas are in what we did this week and \nlast week and the week before, the things you saw and the things we \ntalked about. Those ideas, remember, those are the things we’re \nworking with: [quoting children’s writing] “lost for words”, “speechless \nsometimes” “sitting under the mango tree”, those long hot nights, \npeople reading to you. All those things that came from the work that \nwe’ve done, it’s really beginning to shine through [in your writing]. \n(Arts partner SS) \n \nThis arts partner described the work children did in drama and role play as a \nlived experience: “The things you saw...sitting under the mango tree, those \nlong hot nights...”.  She made explicit to children the nature of their work and \nthe process of internalising and learning. Writing in role, drama and artwork \nconstellated around the novel, but there was no ‘end’ to the project in that it \ndid not culminate either in a long piece of writing or in a performance.   \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n32 \nArts partners blurred the distinction between child and adult learners. Arts \npartners used ideas and frameworks with children that they also used with \nadults. For example, at school E arts partner JB showed Year 2 children how to \nwork with a ‘story quest’ structure to help them tell and write their own \nstories. JB shares this very same concept in workshops for corporate clients \nwho want to overcome adversity in their work lives (see Chapter 7 on Story and \nLiterature). Teachers themselves were gaining confidence and learning new \nskills in art, filmmaking and ICT projects. \n \nModels of working \nGriffeths and Woolf (2003) in their research in Nottingham schools have \nproposed an ‘apprenticeship model’ to describe creative arts partnership \nprojects in classrooms. However the teacher appears increasingly sidelined in \nthis model, as children progress from ‘observer’ and ‘participant’ to ‘novice’ \nand ‘expert’ in a creative arts practice. In the novice phase the teacher is seen \nto \nHelp artist and pupils to frame the activity, negotiate practical issues, \nsupport pupils and artists during the activity \n \nAnd finally, in the ‘expert’ phase only to  \n \nSupervise activities and provide support and advice when requested \n \nThis is in contrast to the ‘apprenticeship model’s’ view of the role of the artist, \nwho in the novice phase \n \nCollaborates with pupils…conveys knowledge of the community of \npractice of which his/her work is located \n \nAnd in the expert phase  \n \nActs as a fellow-expert and offers critical evaluation…may gain new ideas \nand insights from learners for future work. \n \nIn project classrooms we were able to identify other, different models and \napproaches in creative projects. Each model had advantages and \ndisadvantages. Teachers sometimes preferred one way of working over others; \nthis often depended on school and classroom pressures and the extent to which \nindividual teachers wanted to manage projects themselves. We describe these \napproaches here, but not as hard and fast categories. In creative arts projects \nthese approaches can and do interact and overlap. The role of the teacher was \noften to negotiate these models and find a way of working that acknowledged \nand drew on their own expertise as ‘fellow experts’ in learning.   \n \n \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n33 \nThe flying saucer approach \nCultural organisations working in schools may offer an education agenda, lesson \nplans, delivery schedule and pace. They may decide on aims or objectives \nlinked to the National Curriculum Programmes of Study.  There may be \ninfrequent or perhaps only one-off contact between the organisation and \nchildren. The teacher may not know what will happen until the day of the \nsession in school or when the class goes to a performance or workshop. \nResearch field notes reflected this, when members of an opera company gave a \nworkshop at School D before children went to hear the opera outside of school: \n \nThere was no preparation for this workshop visit. Teacher AH said he ‘had \nno idea what they were going to do’. Afterwards AH said it was ‘tricky to \ncomplain when it was offered free of charge!’ The children worked really \nwell and enjoyed the workshop, considering they had no preparation for \nit. Later, AH says, some worksheets arrived but ‘it would have been nice \nto have these beforehand’. \n \nThe ‘flying saucer’ model of working in fact suited Teacher AH. Even when he \nwas not exactly sure what was on offer, he exerted a strong direction and \ninfluence on the children’s learning from these theatre arts experiences. He \ndidn’t have to negotiate class time, resources or focus. He felt there were \nadvantages to working with large institutions rather than an individual artist. \n \nThere was [a lot of] learning going on with the outside \norganisations...[When we went to the theatre] because they told me what \nwas going to happen in the on-stage workshop, I got to observe and \npartake in the workshop myself and look at what the children were doing. \nThey were engaged because they were learning, finding things out, and it \nwas all facilitated by someone else. (Teacher AH) \n \nIn this way of working, the onus is on the teacher to prepare children, extend \nthe experience, make it meaningful and link it to other areas of learning. \nWhere the teacher does not take this role, children’s understanding may be \nvery low-level. \n \nThe long-term outreach approach \nCultural organisations second individual artists to work closely and over time \nacross a school or a Key Stage. In these projects there is a strong element of \n‘delivery’, but the creative practitioners may be experienced in working with \nschools and groups of children. They liaise and plan with teachers, and have at \nleast weekly contact with children. They may organise INSET for teachers as \npart of the package. Children visit the cultural centres, meet professional \npractitioners and learn about their roles. Work in school culminates in a \nperformance or exhibition at the cultural centre itself.   \n \n \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n34 \nIt gives a public arena for their success and their skills, sometimes for \nthe first time. There were children involved who I had not particularly \nnoticed before, they were not very high-profile. Now they stood out. \nOne boy had never been so animated. The performances were the most \nmoving things I have ever seen. They were stunning. The commitment \nthey showed to their dance and their performance, I know absolutely \nhas had a knock-on effect on how they perceive themselves as learners. \nThey were confident, they were part of the group, they were achievers. \n(Headteacher PB) \n \nSchools benefit from working with an individual who can access the resources \nof a large organisation. Children become aware of – and become a part of – \ncommunities of cultural and artistic practice.    \n \nUnique negotiated approach  \nAn individual ‘freelance’ artist may liaise directly with a school to organise a \nproject. These artists may negotiate and plan directly with a teacher what will \nhappen and when. They tend to have regular, often weekly contact with the \nclass. They may take an interest in individual children and spend time \nreflecting with a teacher after lessons. These partnerships are often \ncharacterised by close teacher-arts partner contact via email and telephone \nthroughout the project. \n  \nWe emailed and phoned each other all the time. We still email each other \nnow! We’d talk about how we felt the sessions went, whether we had \ntried to put too much into it, what we would do in the next session, what \nthe children didn’t understand. He would talk to me about what I might do \nwhen he wasn’t there, to follow up, so I did a lot of work when he wasn’t \nthere. We talked about where the project was going, how we felt about \nworking with each other, did we both have a voice in the project? I went \nto his studio. I got to see the work that he has done, and see him as an \nartist.(Teacher MK) \n \nThis type of relationship can have a positive impact on individual teachers. \nWhere they work with more than one teacher across a school or Key Stage, the \narts partner may alter their approach to meet individual teacher’s needs and \nways of classroom organisation. They may give their lesson plans to teachers or \ngive INSET as a way of furthering teacher professional development. However \nwhen this type of work does not extend beyond one classroom there may be \nissues of equity where other classes do not have similar opportunities. \n \n \nProcess, product or both? \nThere were two types of creative project observed in schools: those which \nwere guided by a process and those which were guided by a product.  \n \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n35 \nA ‘process’ partnership offered open-ended questions, themes, \nexperimentation and thinking time. Teachers and children explored unexpected \npaths as ideas emerge and develop. Relationships, knowledge and skills were \nbuilt-up over time as children engaged in the ‘work’ of exploration.  \n \nIt’s not linear…a thought, a memory, watching some one else. Interacting \nwith anybody...It’s like a huge network going on. It’s whole learning. It \nconnects. It’s an investment. It’s like those computer games where you go \naround and collect all these things and sooner or later they all become \nuseful even if you’re not even sure what you have. It’s choosing, it’s an \naesthetic thing, and it’s pleasing as well. There are lots of affirming \nthings going on. (Arts partner GA)    \n \nA ‘product’ partnership worked towards a specific performance or exhibition, \noften in a public space outside of school. It was galvanising, requiring hard \nwork and commitment to meet high, professional standards.  There was an \nurgent timeline and the exhilaration of performing or exhibiting in a \nprofessional space to a real audience.  \n \nIt was nerve-wracking! It was sold out! There were your family and \nfriends, and total strangers you had never seen before. We were there \nfrom 4:30 to 8-o-clock at night. The older children, they were from \nsecondary schools, they cheered us! It felt good...It was special. I had \nnever acted in a big space. We took a bow. When we went through the \ndressing-room they [the theatre staff] were patting us on the \nbacks.(Sorcha, Year 6) \n \nSome successful creative projects were a mixture of process and product where \nthe work of exploration culminated in a ‘performance of understanding’. In \nSchool A, Teacher KR and arts partner NB were successful in communicating to \nchildren the over-arching purpose of their work in film study, drama and \nwriting.    \n \nThe whole project is building towards something. In literacy, sometimes \nthere is nothing they’re working towards at all. They’re just doing a task \nfor the sake of a task. But all the watching of films, all the writing they’re \ndoing, all the drama – it’s all leading towards a particular goal. ... On the \nday of the filming, I hope it all comes together for them: why we looked at \nthose [bullying and violence] issues, why we did those dramas, why we did \nthose storyboards, why we need to know about those particular shots and \nthat particular vocabulary, why we did that writing. It is all focused \ntowards an end product.(Teacher KR) \n \nThrough reflective conversations with the CLPE research officer, teachers in \nAnimating Literacy projects gained a clearer understanding of how creative \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n36 \nprojects may be guided by process or by product.  Teachers felt they could ask \nmore knowledgeable questions about the nature of future projects on offer.   \n \nNow I would make a list of questions for an arts partner, friendly \nquestions, to see what they think is going to happen, how they plan to \nstage the activities so the children understand each step. I would be \nmore aware now whether a creative arts project is more process- or \nproduct-focused and therefore what I would expect the children to \nachieve from it.(Teacher AO) \n \nModels of literacy \nThe models of work in creative arts projects were often very different from \nhow children worked in ‘literacy’. Where teachers followed National Literacy \nStrategy objectives, children’s literacy products were often driven by a rapid \ncoverage of writing genres and their features. Children’s literacy products \nsometimes lacked meaningful contexts. Children were not always able to bring \ntheir knowledge and their narratives to the lesson (see Chapter 5 on Talk). As \nTeacher KR noted, ‘In literacy, sometimes there is nothing they’re working \ntowards at all. They’re just doing a task for the sake of a task’. Likewise, \nexterior forces - curriculum, scheme of work, statutory tests, attainment \ntargets - tended to drive the processes of literacy learning.  \n \nTeachers and children were inexperienced in the development of a long-term \nlearning process in the creative arts and in literacy, and school structures did \nnot always support this way of working.  \n \nTeacher KR: At the moment we’re doing report writing. Prior to that we \ndid narrative poetry. We work from the [National Literacy Strategy} \nobjectives.  \n \nCLPE: How is the creative project different from literacy work? \n \nTeacher KR:  Because it’s starting from where the children are at, it is \ndifferent. With Literacy, you’re doing your report writing or you’re doing \nyour narrative writing. This [creative project] is different because you \ncan be flexible, what is the best way to follow up what they have learned \nor to show what they have learned? Rather than – now we have to do a \nstory. What is the best way to get the ideas out and get them thinking? It \nlooks at children more on an individual level. Some children will do \ndrama and be filmed, other children will be involved other important \nroles in the filming [camera, sound] and still be successful. They won’t \nhave to do something they are uncomfortable with, but they will all be \ninvolved in some way. \n \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n37 \nEffective creative arts projects developed a ‘big picture’ of literacy, life and \nlearning. In very effective projects, teachers and schools were working well \noutside the National Literacy Strategy framework and adapted the National \nCurriculum to the needs of children. They were willing to drop other subjects \ntemporarily in order to develop a creative arts topic or project fully.   \nPlanning issues in classrooms \nArts partners and teachers sometimes had different concepts of planning. Arts \npartners were primarily concerned with the progression of activities within the \nproject. They wanted children to have fun and learn about their specific area \nof expertise. They wanted to help children express themselves.  Although there \nwas a variable range in their experience of working with children, arts partners \nfelt secure in offering their skills and had a strong sense of what they could and \ncouldn’t do. Arts partners typically admitted ‘I don’t know much about the \neducation side of it’ and ‘I’m not a teacher’.  \n \nI’ve never done this with a class before. I’m an artist. I can talk to \npeople about seeing, ways of looking. I’m not a teacher. I’m not used to \nworking with primary children.  I’ll use words like ‘juxtaposition’.(Arts \npartner NA) \n \nTeachers were concerned with stages of children’s understanding, in making \nactivities comprehensible to children and ensuring a successful, and ideally a \nmeasurable, outcome. Teachers hoped to see the creative project positively \ninfluence other areas of children’s learning, such as writing, speaking and \nlistening, or behaviour and motivation. They needed to see learning and \nprogression in the ‘practicum’ experience.  \n \nThe arts partner came and started. It was too abstract. We would have \nprepared the children beforehand if we knew what she was planning. \nWhat she expected was sometimes too difficult...She went too fast. We \nhad to write out lists of her instructions on large paper and post them \naround the room so the children could recall the sequence. They couldn’t \nhold all of her instructions in their heads. Our role really was to support \ngroups and individuals who could not keep up.  \n(Year 3 Teachers SD and JB) \n \nMost arts partners had a clear idea of what they would do in the classroom. \nThey had a vision of the work that would take place.  However, teachers \nsometimes felt that arts partners had not thought sufficiently about the stages \nof children’s learning and how to structure activities so that children \nunderstood them fully, and did not communicate their vision.  \n \nWith one project, it was actually very hard for us teachers to \nunderstand what the artists were describing. It was firmly in their \nheads, but it wasn’t firmly in our heads. They had to talk us through \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n38 \nevery stage, and they weren’t all used to communicating with non-\nartists. They would be talking and we would say, ‘What are you actually \nplanning to do with the children?’  (Headteacher PB) \n \nTeachers often had a great deal to contribute in terms of planning children’s \nlearning and this was not always shared or maximised. In this observation, \nartist NA and storyteller AJ consider a range of possibilities in continuing their \nwork with Year 6 children. They are planning for the children, but they are also \nplanning professionally for themselves: \n   \nAJ: It would be nice to build on what you did, what they noticed \nalready. The main thing is going to be how it [the public exhibition] \nlooks. The story [that I told] could continue. \n \nNA: We could tell the story along a washing line. We discover a story \nfrom you, and retell it in sections, like walking down the street, each \nperson could write a section in as much detail as they can. \n \nAJ: So whatever story I choose needs to be in 19 segments! \n \nNA: You could read the story as a comic strip. \n \nAJ: Each one could choose a bit, and go from the bit with their own \ndetail. \n \nNA: Are they capable of doing their own text? \n \nAJ: There seems to be different levels from what I’ve seen. \n \nNA: Some of them are really on the ball. \n \nAJ:  Think about bits of today’s story. They’ll just get the bit they’re \nsupposed to do. Is that OK with you? I’ll write 19 bare bones, or ‘ribs’. \n \nNA: They’ll do the embellishment. \n \nAJ: Each part will be quite small. They’ll have to bring it alive, all the \ndetail and describing. They don’t have to worry about plot. Each bit has \nto be very detailed, seeing the picture in their heads. They could even \nstart by drawing a picture and writing from the picture. \n \nNA: That’s enough for them to do. You give them their bit, they \nelaborate on it. I’m working with them on how to make a visually \ninteresting piece of paper. \n \nAJ: Groups could act out the story, they hear it and physicalise it. \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n39 \n \nNA: On each table they could help each other. Each piece of ‘clothing’ \n[in the exhibition] will have part of the story. It has to be interesting to \nlook at, so people want to come and read it. It has to have people, \ndetail. Exploring different ideas. We’ll do the plastering in Week 3.  \n \nUnfortunately, this discussion took place without the class teacher’s \ninvolvement. The question whether children were capable of writing their own \ntexts could certainly have been answered by the missing person in this planning \nsession. \n \nWe observed teachers’ mediation and scaffolding of artists’ ideas and plans to \nensure children’s learning in the activities. In a Year 6 class, the arts partner \nenvisaged children writing stories and using a range of media for graphic \nrepresentation in their writing at the same time. The teacher explained that \nthese were two very different and challenging tasks. In this observation, the \nteacher advised the artist how the children would learn most effectively. Yet \nthe issues they discussed, in a rush during children’s play-time, should have \nbeen worked out in planning long before. Un-articulated concerns about \nchildren’s understanding and progression are highlighted: \n  \nTeacher AH: What would be helpful, when you ask a question, is if you \nask them to talk in pairs for a minute, give them time to do this, you \nwould get more out of them...How do you want the tables? What will \nyou want them to do? \n \nArtist NA: They’ll take a piece of the story and do individual writing, \ngraphic writing, like I said. \n \nTeacher AH: It would be better in pairs, definitely. You can give them \ntwo parts of the story. [What you’re asking them to do] I’ve not done \nthat with them. They need to talk about it. They won’t know what to \ndo otherwise. \n \nArtist NA: Are they familiar with chalk, pastels charcoal? I’m \nintroducing some new materials. Africa is dry and dusty, art materials \ncan show that. \n \nTeacher AH: They need to have a play [with the materials], to try out \nwords and materials that aren’t part of the story. Give them time to \npractice the techniques before going into the task... I’d like them to \nlearn something about – have a go at – being storytellers themselves.  \n \nSome teachers realised that they did not devote enough time to planning for a \npartnership, because they believed the artist would automatically know how to \ncreate a learning context. As one teacher put it, “I thought it would just \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n40 \nhappen, by magic.” Teachers may expect an arts partner to take a lead role in \nthe class but then be disappointed at the arts partner’s lack of teaching skill. \n \nI thought having an arts partner coming into class would be different to \nthe work we did with the outside organisations [a theatre and an opera \ncompany], but it is no different. I still have to plan and manage the \nlearning… When you go to somewhere outside, they are the specialist, it’s \ntheir environment. When you work with the outside organisation you \nthink you might have less control. But actually when the artist comes into \nyour class, control may be lost more. (Year 6 teacher AH)  \n \nTeachers were sometimes frustrated at what they saw as lost opportunities or \nlack of commitment from some arts partners. Most frustrating for teachers was \nnot knowing what the arts partners’ plans were.   \n \nI asked them to email me their planning but they didn’t. I didn’t know \nwhat was going to happen. I thought the children would be learning to \ntell stories. The arts partner told stories, but she wasn’t teaching the \nchildren how to become storytellers themselves. It was nice. It was OK. \nBut it should have been so much more. (Year 6 teacher AH) \n \nWe were very aware that the artists were not teachers. I did do some \ntraining of arts partners really, things like – you need to have everything \nready! You need to be here at half-past-eight!...It is about understanding \nthe culture of the school. Some artists thought it would be acceptable to \npass unfinished work to the teacher and say, ‘Can you finish this?’  I said, \n‘No, you can’t do that – if you initiate a task, you must finish it.’ It could \nbe stressful due to time management and work not being completed in \nthe blocks as we had planned. Teachers understand that you have to \nfinish within a certain time.(Nursery teacher and school creative projects \ncoordinator RM) \n \n Artists may not understand how awful it is for teachers to see their \nroom, its order and structure, disrupted. (Year 6 teacher and literacy \ncoordinator CJ) \n \nBecause arts partners were focused on activities, they could sometimes \noverlook opportunities for children’s learning. Teachers however were \nexperienced in recognising and seizing these moments. For example, in School \nC, artists helped children design and make a life-sized ship in a studio space. \nChildren immediately used the ship for imaginary play.           \n \nThe role-play came from the children. The arts partners only thought about \nmaking a ship. The children weren’t having any of that! They were \nmermaids and pirates. They were building a narrative. We developed it \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n41 \ninto books and stories about mermaids and pirates and more role-play and \nartwork. (Nursery teacher BL)   \n \nTeacher knowledge of children’s literature, stories and poetry extended the \nlearning possibilities in creative projects (see Chapter Seven).  Teacher BL \nknows that children learn and develop language through imaginary play. They \nuse what they have made (a ship) to become ‘mermaids and pirates’, they step \ninto and enact other roles. What they have made is not only an aesthetic \nobject, it has the power to transform their classroom into another setting (the \nsea) and turn children into adventurers and creatures. Teacher BL observes the \nchildren building narratives, and she uses this opportunity to bring in books, \nstories and reading.  \nGift horses? \nIn interviews when teachers were asked who was leading their projects, two \nteachers admitted “I’m not sure.” An alarming finding in interviews was that \nteachers who were unhappy or dissatisfied with a partnership were unwilling to \nhalt the project or change it. Even though teachers’ knowledge and practice \nwere crucial in mediating creative projects, months would pass before teachers \nwould reluctantly express dissatisfaction to arts partners over ways of working, \nresources or activities. They were more likely to say nothing and, as one \nteacher put it, “make the best of a bad situation”. Typical comments, even \nfrom experienced teachers, were: “It was planned. I had agreed to it. The \nsessions were all booked.”   \n \n[The arts partner] was trialling her QCA unit and I wasn’t happy with it. I \nhad misread it. I thought it was going to be something else. It was way too \nfast. The two different concepts, design and making, together were too \nmuch for the children. But I didn’t feel as though I could change it. It had \nbeen planned and agreed to. (Year 5 teacher JA in School J)  \n \nIn school C, teachers were unhappy with one of the arts partners. They felt he \nwas unable to relate sympathetically to very young children. Ultimately the \nschool’s head teacher intervened to remove him.  \n \nThe reasons for this reluctance to confront problems varied. Teachers viewed \ncreative projects as ‘gifts’ that they would appear churlish to criticise or \nreject. Creative projects were expensive resources, sometimes presented as \nprivileges, and not every teacher got one. Creative projects were yet another \neducational initiative for teachers to interpret, accommodate and manage. \nOfficial directives on ‘creativity’ (ie QCA Creativity: Find It Promote It) \nappeared to them to conflict with other government messages about \nattainment and standards.     \n \n \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n42 \nConflicting demands \nAnna Craft (2004) suggests that creativity is ‘distinct from the roles and \nprocesses of school’. This was a problematic issue in creative projects observed \nfor this research. For example in School B, teachers felt that the dance lessons \nwere ‘totally different to anything on offer in our school’ and this was one of \nthe less effective projects. Where creative arts projects were too distinct from \nschool routines and experiences, teachers felt pressure and conflict.    \n \nWe observed projects where teachers and arts partners had very good \nrelationships and where children’s learning and engagement were evident. \nNevertheless teachers experienced what Robin Alexander (2004) described as \nthe tension between “the ostensible offer of autonomy” of creative projects \nand the “increasing hegemonisation of the curriculum through the [national] \nstrategies, the three part [literacy hour] lesson and plenary becoming the \ntemplate for everything”. Teachers often had to work hard to accommodate \ncreative projects and the interventions of arts partners. The extent to which \nteachers had to adapt or change their own teaching patterns was a factor in \nthe success of creative projects.   \n \nInterviews and observations revealed different and sometimes conflicting roles, \nexpectations, desires and anxieties of teachers and arts partners. Different \nviews of learning and of children as learners emerged in classroom \npartnerships. Teachers and arts partners sometimes had different expectations \nof children and different, often implicit models of progression and of learning. \nThey had to negotiate their understandings of how children learn, what \nchildren would do and what the learning ‘outcome’ would be. Teachers in \nparticular had to create conditions for learning in professional relationships \nthat could feel unequal.  \n \nIn art and craft work, and in something like dance, I think there are quite \na lot of teachers who are anxious that their own lack of skills in these \nareas might be exposed when an arts partner is coming in. When the arts \npartner comes in, although you know the children will enjoy it, it can be \nvery unsettling for the teacher. It might be difficult to begin work with \nthe arts partner at first. You need to build up the relationship with the \narts partner very carefully so teachers can gain confidence, so they can \nspread the message to other, less confident teachers. Otherwise, it could \nbe very negative. \n(Headteacher PB)  \n \nTeachers and arts partners saw themselves differently as professionals in \nrelation to children’s learning. Teachers were driven by curriculum and \nassessment criteria at both school and national levels; they were trained and \nultimately required to be concerned with children’s attainment targets.  \nIn this sense, ‘Creativity’ was another form of government intervention in \nteaching.  \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n43 \n \nIn Animating Literacy action research (Elllis & Safford 2005), teachers \noverwhelmingly interpreted creative arts projects in terms of the government’s \nstandards agenda, for example by linking dance, story-telling or theatre arts to \nchildren’s attainment targets in writing. Teachers often felt personally \nresponsible for children reaching their set targets. They felt they could not \nsquander curriculum time, and there was no perceived space for a project to \ndrift, flounder or fail. \n \nWe are responsible for meeting their [children’s] targets. We set their \ntargets last week. At the end of the day, they have to meet their targets. \nWe have to show how we moved them on. The only assessment that \ncounts is the SATS. Because time is so tight, at the end of the year we \nhave to justify how we have moved them on. It [the creative arts project] \nfeels like a massive risk...To lose a day, an hour, is too much. This is \ntheir education and we can’t waste one minute.(Year 2 teacher SP) \n \nIt’s all very well to put arts and arts partners in schools, But how you \nactually carry it out in practice is very, very difficult. It throws up all \nkinds of issues. (Year 2 teacher AR) \n \nArts partners were unaffected by these constraints and concerns and could in \nfact choose not to engage with them even as they worked in school contexts.   \n \nMy heart is in being able to work in a different way. I would be very \nbored and stressed having to work to a set curriculum. (Arts partner NB) \n \nIt would be impossible for me to ‘deliver’ something that I didn’t ‘own’. \nSo much has to be delivered, it’s impossible to own it. \n(Arts partner GA) \n \nTurf \nArts partners had a very clear vision of what defined them and what their role \nwas in the class. This was often in direct opposition to what they saw as the \nteacher’s role.  \n \nMy objectives are different [from teachers’]. I’ve got a different \nperspective. They’ve got targets. My targets are based purely on what \nthe children give me. My intention is to go there and create as much \npleasure and joy as possible, to make something fun and memorable. \n(Arts partner GA) \n \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n44 \nArts partners felt they brought out the best in children and showed teachers \naspects of children of which teachers were unaware. Arts partners believed \ntheir way of working supported children’s learning. \n \n[Teachers] have said to us – oh, that is a side of that child that I’ve \nnever seen before, [children] show you this, or that. What we do shows \nup aspects of their personalities that cannot be shown in the medium of \nthe classroom: the expressive, free self, the spontaneous self. It’s very \nhard to be spontaneous in the classroom, where you have to answer \nspecific questions. Our questions are open. How you choose to answer \nit, what you draw on, comes from you personally. So it’s affirming. It \nvalidates them as individuals and therefore builds confidence.(Arts \npartner GA) \n \nArts partners were willing for projects to be explorations without pre-set \noutcomes. Artist NB said of the filmmaking project in School A, ‘We’re on a \njourney, we don’t know what the outcome might be’. Arts partners often \nreflected on their own practice as they worked with children.  \n \nIt doesn’t matter what we come up with today. It’s an experiment. \n(Arts partner NA to Year 6 children) \n \nIt’s about experimenting and experiencing. Trying out ideas. ...[your] \nbrains are going – oooh, that feels nice, oooh, I like that! Let me keep \nthat, let me practice that again, here is something else, I’ll connect \nthat. It’s a constant dialogue, fitting things together, new ideas popping \nout. (Arts partner GA to Year 1 and Year 2 children) \n \n We were exploring drawing as a process, less a finished product. Children \nlove talking about the process, what they are going in their drawing. \nThere are parallels with my own practice. Young children give so much. \nIt’s a two-way street. (Arts partner ED) \n \nArts partners often did not know where a session might lead and they \ncommunicated this to children. Unlike most teachers, arts partners never told \nchildren at the beginning of a session what their ‘Learning Intention’ was. They \ntook a positive approach to uncertainty and were open to different possible \noutcomes.     \n \nBecause arts partners so clearly staked-out their territory in creative projects, \nteachers tended to take on supporting and ‘fixing’ roles. They tended to follow \nthe Griffeths and Woolf (op.cit) ‘apprenticeship’ model. They described their \nwork mainly in terms of mediation and facilitation, but also saw themselves as \nresponsible for extending children’s learning in creative projects through: \n \n \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n45 \n- Being the bridge between the artists and the children \n- ‘Becoming small’ in order to observe and listen to children \n- Taking part and joining in \n- Explaining activities in different ways to make them comprehensible \n- Modelling to the arts partner how to talk to children \n- Playing ‘devil’s advocate’ to clarify arts partner’s meaning \n- Helping individuals and groups \n- Ensuring fairness, calming squabbles  \n- Thinking about the ‘lead up’ and preparation children may need \n- Making it easier for the project to succeed \n- Differentiating work \n- Using knowledge of individual children to deploy additional resources or \nsupport \n- Extending the work and children’s learning from the experience  \n \nOur role is often to model language. Sometimes the children don’t \nunderstand what the arts partner is saying. We also tell the arts partner \nwhat will work and what won’t work with children, or really how to \nstage the activities in the best way for the children so they \nunderstand.(Nursery teachers BL and AB) \n \nWhere teachers did assert their territory, it was in relation to their knowledge \nof children’s abilities and needs.  \n \nSince [the arts partner] didn’t know the children, she didn’t know what \nthey were or weren’t capable of.  The arts partner was not aware of \nwhere to move the children on to. We know where they can be moved on \nto.(Year 3 teachers SD and JB)  \n \nArts partners come in with their expertise, but I also think what is \nimportant is that the artist knows that their expertise is the art side, and \nthe teacher will be more or less confident with that aspect. But the \nknowledge and understanding of the children must still lie with the \nteacher... It’s about understanding where children are in their \nintellectual development. It’s about the interaction between the artist \nand the teacher. That is key... The two things together, the arts \nspecialist and the teacher, make a very powerful partnership because \nthey are both bringing something that they are definitely experts in, and \ntogether each can learn more about the other side of the \npartnership.(Year 6 teacher and literacy coordinator CJ)  \n \nSome children also expressed the view that the arts partner may not \nunderstand them as well as the class teacher. \n \n \n \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n46 \n[Arts partners] TM, he doesn’t really know much about my work. He’s \nnot always working with me. He says it’s good anyway, but he can’t say \nif it’s better or not because he ain’t seen it. (Jordan, Year 5) \n \nAttitudes to children \nArts partners saw pleasure as a key ingredient to learning. They were generally \nmore relaxed than teachers and often had a laugh with children.   \n \nI like spending time with kids. They’re so cheeky! (Arts partner NA) \n \n Boys this age [Year 6] remind me of chestnuts bursting out of their \ncasings! All shiny! (Arts partner AJ)   \n \nHumour is so important. They always see us laughing in class. It \nsimulates them to do more. (Arts partner GA) \n \nBrian, Year 5 to arts partner JB: Can you help me? \nJB: Sorry, you have to wait, I’m working with Calvin. \n[Brian. sulks]  \nJB: That’s life man, one big queue! [everyone laughs] \n \nArts partners were also aware of the demands their specialisms put on children. \nArts partners always praised children after lessons and noted children’s efforts. \nThey linked effort and enjoyment, and after sessions would comment \nappreciatively on the work that children had done. \n  \n- I hope you enjoyed that. \n- I hope you had fun, I saw that you were working really hard. \n- Thank you for your hard work \n- Did you enjoy that? I enjoyed that. I could see you really concentrating. \n- You have worked so hard today. \n \nThey’re working really, really hard. They work hard in that lesson. Their \nbrains have been going. They’re exhausted at by the end of it. In their \nclass work, they work on something for 20-minutes maximum. In dance \nthey work much longer. It’s quite personal, it’s yours, not on a piece of \npaper, it’s in your body. You’ve used those muscles, those brain cells. \nAnd it’s not ‘marked’. (Arts partner GA) \n \nTeachers rarely spoke to children in this way. After sessions with arts partners, \nteachers were more likely to ask children ‘What did you learn?’ It was startling \nin observations that teachers sharing the same experiences as arts partners and \nchildren rarely described learning as fun, enjoyable and hard work.  1 \n                                                 \n1 In observations, Learning Support Assistants (LSAs) often used the same language as arts partners when \ntalking to children, e.g.  \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n47 \n \nArts partners were generally not bothered by children’s inattention or poor \nbehaviour. They saw this as children taking a ‘brain break’. Teachers however \nwere particularly sensitive on these issues when handing over their class to the \narts partner. What an arts partner viewed as temporary ‘wandering off’ or \npersonal thinking time, teachers viewed as lack of concentration and/or \nrespect.  \n \n The arts partner sees a boy spinning around on his bottom, not paying \nany attention and says, ‘Oh he’s being creative.’ I say he’s taking the \npiss. (Year 2 teacher SP) \n \nI was really annoyed with the children, they really weren’t focussed. I \nwanted them to be more focused and appreciate the opportunity [of \nworking with arts partner NB]. (Year 5 teacher KR) \n \nTeachers often took on the unsatisfying role of behaviour manager in sessions \nwith arts partners: Teacher K excluded five boys from an activity on eight \noccasions during one session and later admitted, “Once I start looking at \nbehaviour, it’s all over for me.” This same year 5 teacher summed-up the \ndifference in how she and her arts partner view the children:  \n \n[Arts partner] NB sees them as little children, I tend not to see them that \nway. N sees them as younger than I do. She tends to say, well, they are \nonly young, what they come up with is fine and good. She was always happy \nwith what they gave her... She does have a positive view of the children. \nShe sees them as individuals...It’s an extra perspective. She gets quite \nenthused about any of the work they do and their ideas and doesn’t expect \ntoo much whereas I expect them to do quite a lot. (Year 5 teacher KR) \n \nExpectations of children’s behaviour and learning were key issues in \npartnerships. Teachers rarely thought arts partners got it right. They tended to \nthink that arts partners expected too much (working at too fast a pace and not \nexplaining sufficiently) or expecting too little of children. However creative \nprojects sometimes implicitly forced teachers to examine on their own \nexpectations of children and of the curriculum.     \n \n                                                                                                                                                 \n \nLSA at School EW: I’ve been working with you all along on this, and you have been so enthusiastic \nand you worked so hard, to see it all put together like this is just fantastic.   \n \nLSA at School SPS: You were lovely [dancing], turning around, pleasure on your faces...it was a \nbeautiful lesson and you will remember it. \n \nLSA at School MF: Well done, I saw you were working hard. I really enjoyed watching you.  \n \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n48 \nIt has been nice to work with a professional who is not a teacher. She \n[arts partner NB] has different ideas about things, and she sees things \ndifferently... She sees them more as little children than I do. My \nexpectations are higher, so she is balancing that. She said, ‘No, these \nwere the things that came out of the session, don’t worry, we’ll be fine, \nwe will do things differently’. She has a fresher approach. It’s been good \nto throw ideas back and forwards, she is very much part of the process. \n(Year 5 teacher KR) \n       \nIt’s a new way of looking at learning. Children may have quite a stylised \nidea of what is ‘good’ in drawing, or in dance. It’s about freeing up \nchildren’s ideas of what is ‘good’.  Drawing, like other work with arts \npartners, is one of those things in the curriculum that isn’t right or \nwrong. You do it your way, it can’t be wrong. That’s how the artist makes \nit. \n(Nursery teacher and school creative projects coordinator RM) \n  \nTeachers reported that they were able to observe their classes, often for the \nfirst time, in creative arts projects. With opportunities to observe, teachers \nnoticed changes in children’s confidence, attitudes to learning, language and \ncognitive activity (See Chapter Four, Class Studies). Teachers also reported \nimprovements to their own practice as a result of partnerships, not only in \nskills but also in awareness of and attitudes to the children themselves. \n \n I try now, every day, to see the children in a positive light, to see \nsomething good about them, every day. To not get dragged down. To see \nthem the way my arts partner saw them. JB noticed things I don’t notice. \nIn objective-led teaching I wasn’t noticing a lot of things. \n(Year 2 teacher AO) \n     \n[Arts partner] NB does pick out things about individual children. She has \nfresh eyes for things they do because she sees them once a week. She \nnotices things about their writing but also about their speaking and \nlistening. She’ll say: ‘Did you see I.? She spoke so loudly, I’ve never seen \nher speak like that, she is so much more confident now.’ It helps me to \nnotice the positives as well. (Year 5 teacher KR)   \n \nThe artist sees things differently to the way I would see them. An artist \nwould say, ‘This is wonderful, look at the freedom in that drawing’. It \nmade me look at their work differently. \n(Nursery teacher and school creative projects coordinator RM) \n \n \n \n \n \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n49 \nAbsolutely. I would be looking, and I would always see one or two \nchildren who would really surprise me. When you’re teaching yourself, \nthere may be children that you don’t focus on. With this you could, \nbecause some one else was teaching.(Year 6 teacher and literacy \ncoordinator CJ) \nRole models and messages \nIn observations, professional arts practitioners conveyed messages to children \nthat were different from school and teacher messages. Arts practitioners spoke \nof their personal satisfaction in hard work and becoming proficient. In these \nseparate observations, Year 6 children question an opera singer and an opera \ncomposer:   \n \n    (1) \nSam: Do you ever lose your voice on stage, does it hurt your throat? \n \nSinger SR: No, no, I’ve had years of practice. This is what I do for my job, \nsinging in opera. I had seven years of music college, a long time. \n \nSam: When you walk on the street do opera fans recognise you? When you \nget to that high pitch, how do you do it?  \n \nSinger SR: Years and years of practice. \n \n    (2) \nJanice: What is the nicest thing about being a composer? \n \nComposer OD: You’re always learning. You never know what it’s going to \nsound like, and it gets better, it improves. Some things you’re pleased \nwith, others you’re not. You carry on learning...I’m really happy even \nthough I don’t earn a lot of money. The nice thing about my job is I don’t \ndo the same thing every day. I write, I travel, visit schools work at the \nopera house. If I won the lottery I wouldn’t change much...In the opera \nthere are hundreds of jobs, painting sets, designing, singing, wardrobe. \nThere are jobs for all of you out there. \n \nTeacher AH observed these messages and children’s interest in them. He began \nto emulate creative practitioner language that linked experience, expertise \nand enjoyment.  \n \nAH: I hope that [workshop with the composer] has been useful for you. I \nfound it really useful. That is somebody’s job when they leave school, to \nearn money. Do you think he enjoys his job?  \n \nChildren: Yes! \n \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n50 \nAH: Do you think everybody in the world enjoys their jobs? \n \nChildren: No! \n \nAH: He’s followed his dream to do something he enjoyed. If you’ve got a \ntalent, it could be anything, music, writing, sports, you could wake up in \nthe morning and think: I can’t wait to go to work today. \n \nTeacher AH said later \n \nI really noticed how they [theatre and opera staff] talked to the children. \nSo I started, consciously, trying to talk like that too. I did a Maths lesson \nwhere we were swinging a big pendulum and counting-up in sevens. And \nafterwards I said to M. ‘Did you enjoy that?’ and he smiled and said ‘Yeah \nI did enjoy that.’ It was like I was putting the idea into their heads that \nthey enjoyed it, and they began to enjoy it! (Year 6 teacher AH) \n \nSeveral arts partners had had very negative school experiences and had \nempathy for disaffected pupils. They were aware that they had a positive \nimpact on children routinely labelled ‘behaviour problems’.  \n \nHere I am in school again. I can’t believe it! It has left a legacy actually. \nIt took a long time to come to terms and overcome the feelings it left me \nwith. I found a way of dealing with it. Now I want to find ways of working \nthat I feel comfortable and confident about and not how that experience \nleft me. That’s what I’m doing now. \n(Arts partner NB) \n \nWhen we ask [the teacher] for one more group – after everyone has \nhad a go – and the teacher says we can choose whoever has worked \nwell with us earlier, we choose and the teacher can be amazed! \nThese are often the children with ‘behaviour’ issues in class. (Arts \npartner JC) \n \nSome arts practitioners were frank about not doing well in school themselves \nbut discovering their talents in other areas. They signalled to children that \nstruggling in school is normal. \n \n[As a child] I really liked music and I wasn’t good at anything \nelse. I was terrible at maths and PE. If you’re not so good at some \nthings, that’s fine. It’s fine to struggle with some things, that’s \nlife. (Arts partner OD to Year 6 children)  \n \nThe impact of ethnic minority and bilingual arts partners in schools where \nethnic minority children are majorities cannot be underestimated. In School B, \nYear 1 and 2 ethnic minority children were astonished and mesmerised to see \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n51 \nBlack dancers when the class visited a professional dance studio. Their teacher \nSP observed: ‘They identified with the Black dancer, they were impressed by \nhow well he danced, how strong he was and they were keen to be picked to \nwork in his group.’ Black actors and theatre technicians had a similar impact \non Year 6 children at School D, where teacher AH noted: ‘It’s as if they see \nthemselves, it’s like their future in front of them.’  \n \nIn School E, Portuguese artist ML was able to speak with Year 5 and 6 children \nin their first language; they used Portuguese for learning, making and crafting.  \nIn the same school, a Year 2 girl wrote to JB, an African Caribbean storyteller: \n‘I miss you. You are like a teacher.’ Where ethnic minority and bilingual arts \npartners work in schools, they offer more than celebrations of diversity.  They \noffer children powerful models of and purposes for education and literacy.    \n \nInteractive, reflective partnerships   \nIn effective creative arts projects teachers and arts partners made time to lay \nthe groundwork for close professional relationships. Where teachers and artists \nobserved each other teaching the class before starting their projects, each \npartner got a feeling for the teaching style of the other.  From this initial \n‘getting to know you’ activity more meaningful planning and discussion would \nfollow. \n \nIn these partnerships teachers and arts partners were in constant \ncommunication throughout projects, through email, telephone calls and \nmeetings. They reviewed the situation at the end of every session to decide \nwhere to next direct the children’s learning. Each area of teacher and artist \nexpertise was maximised and shared in a friendly and professional manner, as \nthis exchange of emails (between a teacher and an artist following a studio \nsession for children) indicates:  \n  \nThe children really enjoyed the workshop and I feel they work best when \nit is in an informal atmosphere (which it was). So it would probably be \nbest to continue with what we did last week, perhaps starting off with \nlooking at the work they have already done and then carrying on with \nmore drawing. (Nursery teacher AB) \n \nI really enjoyed the workshop and felt it went really well. The children \nseemed to enjoy sewing with the wool and created some really \ninteresting images and shapes. I have exposed their stitched pieces in the \ndarkroom and they’ve created some really interesting and beautiful \nimages. I’ll bring them along to the next workshop. So we should have \nsimilarly exciting results with the light sensitive paper. (Arts partner ED) \n \nArts partners in these relationships were sympathetic about the pressures on \nteachers. They appreciated teachers’ efforts to ensure projects were successful \nand to disseminate the project in the school.    \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n52 \nI have to fight so hard for INSET, teachers have only a finite amount of \nINSET time. The last time, I had half an hour. It comes back to how the \nschools accommodate the partnership, the spirit of it. By Monday \nteachers are ground back down again. Teachers’ needs must be built \ninto the planning and how you work. (Arts partner TM) \n \n For me this project was a real joy, because however open I might be to \nthis process, a teacher might not necessarily be that open to it or \nempowered to do that. [Teacher KR] is completely open and prepared to \nlearn and contribute. She has the head-space to do that. She is totally \nengaged with the children’s learning processes and is not rigid about \nhow that might happen. (Arts partner NB) \n \nSuccessful partnerships existed in individual classrooms in very different kinds \nof schools. In two cases, in fact, the successful partnership classrooms existed \nas islands in indifferent and sometimes unsupportive school curricula and \ncultures. In two other schools where children are streamed by ability for \nliteracy and numeracy, partnerships were less effective simply because \nteachers and children saw less of each other and therefore had less contact and \ntime to develop and sustain the work.  \n \nShared professional development \nIn effective partnerships, teachers valued the unique contributions of arts \npartners for their own professional development in addition to children’s \nlearning. Every teacher interviewed was on a personal learning continuum.  \n \nI think you want your arts partner to show you something that you can’t \nimagine, to completely open your eyes to something you’ve never seen or \nthought of before. I don’t want my arts partner to think the same way as \nme, because I can do that for myself.  \n(Reception teacher JC) \n \nIt was a revelation in my practice to learn that storytelling had to do with \nwriting. (Year 2 teacher AO) \n \nI see teaching now as making links, connections with everything all \naround us, whether this is working with an outside organisation or with \nan artist in the classroom. It all has to be connected to make sense to the \nchildren. (Year 6 teacher AH) \n \n[Arts partner] SS taught me how to pause in the narrative and explore a \nmoment or a scene in it, how to expand a moment and not always be \npushing the narrative forward. It’s really changed the way I teach drama \nnow. (Year 5 teacher GD) \n \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n53 \nI have learned a lot, how to reach out to children who don’t learn in \ntraditional ways. (Year 2 teacher SP)  \n \nFollowing an art project at School I, the entire teaching staff decided to take \nlife drawing classes after school at a local arts college. \n  \nEvery teacher will be getting something from it either because they are \nvery passionate, or because they’re not quite so passionate or not so \nconfident but there will be something about that project which will inspire \nthem and will increase their practice and their confidence. It’s not just \nabout how we are when the experience is going on, it’s how we are after \nthe experience is over and what we are going forward with… It has changed \nthe way everyone works. It has permanently changed what we do. (Nursery \nteacher RM and Year 6 teacher CJ) \n \nArts partners also gained professionally from their experiences in schools. They \nviewed projects as opportunities to offer their knowledge and expertise and to \nimprove the quality of school life and children’s education. They were always \nfascinated by children’s development.  \n \nThe most unexpected outcome has been how much the children’s work \nhas informed my own practice as an artist. The way they view their work \nhas allowed me to look at my own work in a new way. I notice also the \nenjoyment and interest the children have in the process of a workshop as \nopposed to the finished drawing or image...You never know what to \nexpect. Children are extremely creative. Their language has changed \nnoticeably. They now use much longer sentences to describe their work or \nobservations. They also seem less inhibited in expressing their \nimaginative interpretations of image or process.  \n(Arts partner ED) \n \nThe more we demystify how arts work, how arts help children learn, the \nbetter. Artists have to work within the curriculum, to justify being in \nschools. And we have to help teachers understand what we do.  \n(Arts partner GA)  \n  \nEffective creative projects promoted reflective practice. Conversations \n‘surfaced’ the tacit professional knowledge of teachers and artists as they \nexchanged perspectives and tested out new materials and approaches.   \n \nWhen I make an observation, [arts partner] SS can put a name to it. It \nbecomes concrete knowledge for me. I said that the children referred to \neach other as the characters of the novel, calling each other ‘Aysha’ or \n‘Dadi’. SS said that they had ‘reached the point of sustained role’. (Year \n5 teacher GD) \n \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n54 \nI am also learning a lot from [teacher] KR because the class is very \nchallenging. She is really positive and supportive but can also tell me \nhonestly where things don’t work so well. Once I did something with \ndrama and she was really clear about why that didn’t work and it was \nreally helpful. She knows those young people inside out. She knows their \nstories, really knows what makes them tick. She is very generous making \nsure that I am in on that. (Arts partner NB) \n \nA significant factor in the success of creative arts projects was the relationship \nbetween the arts partner and the teacher. Their effective negotiations as \nprofessionals created the ‘magic’ teachers hoped for. In effective projects \nteachers and arts partners developed a shared view of children’s learning and \nwould air their views regularly in conversations, e.g.:  \n \nThere was an equality of thinking [in children’s talk and writing] that \nreminds me that children are not half-human, they are fully human. \nWorking in drama is a constant reminder...We had one eye on the \nmaterial and one eye on the children’s responses. (Arts partner SS) \n \nWe were really observing the children. (Teacher GD) \n \n We used what children know. It was very child centred, and I don’t like \nto use that word because it has such bad connotations. (Arts partner SS) \n \nThis ‘magic’ was best sustained and disseminated when the school vision and \nethos supported the work in classrooms. Where artists worked beyond \nindividual classrooms, across Key Stages or year groups over time, teachers and \nschools were able to evaluate projects on a wider scale. They could then \nconsider changes to teacher and school practices and how to build progression \ninto long-term creative projects across age phases.  \n \n‘Enabling’ and ‘constraining’ factors (as noted by Doherty & Harland in 2001 for \nNFER) did occur simultaneously even in very effective creative arts projects. \nMost constraining was a narrow interpretation of the curriculum (ie linking \ndance to Literacy Hour objectives) and school context (ie streaming; where \nschools streamed children by ability, partnerships were less effective because \nteachers had less contact with children and less time to embed and extend \nproject work). Strict timetables where each subject had its ‘slot’, frequent \ntarget-setting and testing likewise constrained creative arts development.  \n \nMost enabling was the personal and professional commitment of the teacher. \nTeacher beliefs and practice were crucial to the success and effectiveness of \ncreative arts projects, which involved considerable work for teachers outside of \ncurriculum and assessment parameters. No matter how skilled the creative \nartist, it was the teacher who made a project work for children’s learning in \nthe school environment. As we will show in the next chapter, arts partners \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n55 \ncould not develop projects in the face of teacher resistance. In other cases, \nextensive teacher input beyond weekly (or less frequent) arts partner sessions \nensured the embedding and the effectiveness of creative arts projects.  \n \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n56 \n \n  \n  \n               Chapter 4 \n \n \n Class studies in creative arts projects \n \n \n \n \n \nI want to be a footballer.

In Chapter Six \nwe shall go on to analyse children’s exemplar texts from these projects.  \n \nIn the most effective projects, three creativities were continually present: the \nteacher, the arts partner and the children were all equally engaged and \ncommitted in the learning process of the project.  But this three-way creativity \nwas not always in evidence in project classrooms. We also present here a \nproject in dance that was less effective and we consider the underlying reasons \nfor this. We present this class study not as a critique of an individual project \nbut to illustrate factors that may hinder the positive impact of creative arts \nprojects in schools.  \n \nThis chapter draws on data collected in classrooms over four terms: \nobservations, field notes, interviews with children, teachers and arts partners, \nchildren’s individual and collaborative texts, children’s recorded talk and their \ncreative products. Teachers also contributed from their own notes and records. \nWe examine each project in these particular areas:  \n \n¾ School and classroom context for the project \n¾ The aims or questions underpinning the project \n¾ What kind of work the children did in the project \n¾ The range and quality of children’s talk in the project \n¾ The range and quality of children’s writing in the project \n¾ Developments for individual children or the class \n¾ Outcomes   \n  \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n58 \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Class Study One: Finding yourself in a book \n \n  Year 5 in School H  \n  Teacher GD, Arts partner SS \n  A one-term drama project \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n59 \n \nContext  \nSchool H is an oasis in a deprived inner city estate.

Children \nwould develop writing and artwork simultaneously around their reading of a \ntext, often presenting their writing with, or even as part of, their artwork.   \n \nTeacher GD worked with a drama specialist, arts partner SS for one term. \nAlthough GD had often used drama in her teaching, she said she ‘experienced a \nreal conceptual leap’ when working with SS by realising the difference between \ndrama as exploration and theatre skills as performance ‘and I’ll never confuse \nthe two again’. GD and SS had a shared view of the curriculum and they \nbelieved that drama could create powerful contexts for learning and for \nwriting.   \n \nI knew you could make it [drama] slightly more abstract, deeper into \ncharacter, emotion, not always concerned with the narrative so much. \nYou could end up with even stronger understanding, and you could take it \nin different ways. (Teacher GD)    \n \nTeacher GD and arts partner SS planned the project in consultation with school \ncolleagues. In weekly discussions they reflected on a wide range of practical \nand pedagogic issues. \n \nAims \nThis was the only Animating Literacy project to work extensively around a \nwhole text, a novel (Lost for Words by Elizabeth Lutzier) about a girl who \nemigrates from Bangladesh to London. The project’s enquiry was whether a \nculturally relevant text would engage a group of girls (Tasneen, Rahela and \nLara). They were learners with English as an Additional Language who rarely \nparticipated in class discussions. Teacher GD was concerned about these girls \nwho always seemed to be on the margins of the class.  \n \n Tasneen was a classic EAL child, standing back, not joining in, using only \nwords she knew. She would say ‘I don’t know’ when she really didn’t \nknow the words to use. (Teacher GD)  \n \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n60 \nThe project’s wider enquiry was how drama could enhance children’s \nunderstanding of the novel and create a safe place to discuss issues such as \nmigration, racism and Islam sensitively in the school learning context.    \nTeacher GD had intuited that the novel would engage many children in her \nclass who may have had similar experiences to the fictional ‘Aysha’ of the \nnovel. Although the enquiry was about the girls with EAL, the drama work was \nnot ‘aimed’ at them and the girls were observed in the context of whole class \nwork. The project became a deep exploration of identity that engaged the \nwhole class and led to a wide range of fiction and non-fiction writing. \n \nProject work: developing drama skills for exploration \nBecause of the short time frame, Teacher GD and arts partner SS decided that \nthere would be no ‘end’ product in a dramatic performance but that children’s \nwork would be a series of explorations of the world of the novel.  Through role \nplay and drama, the class examined familiar and unfamiliar themes raised by \nthe novel: separation, leaving home, arriving in a new country, coping with \nchange, racism and bullying, acts of kindness and hopes for the future. \n \nThese explorations were underpinned by explicit teaching in how to ‘work’ in \ndrama. Specific drama skills taught to children included freeze framing, \nthought-tracking, ‘alley of consciousness’ and working ‘in role’.  Arts partner SS \nquickly (and, in Teacher GD’s notes, ‘very strictly’) taught the children skills \nand vocabulary that enabled them to improvise effectively, as this observation \nof the class in action illustrates: \n  \nArts partner SS: “Can you get to your starting point from last week \nwithout talking?”  \n \nThe children remember their positions very well. As soon as SS claps her \nhands, the children are in a playground with [the character in the novel] \n‘Aysha’ in her new school. The children freeze in a position, playing, \nlooking and talking, and when SS claps a second time they change to \nanother ‘freeze frame’.  \n \nSS: “Make sure you do not go out of your working space.  Think about the \nquality of the noise in the dream sequence itself.  You need to have a \nCLEAR FINISHING POINT, you can decide that in your group”   \n \nSS observes children practising. The focus girls are taking the lead in \ntheir groups. Tasneen leads her group by explicitly suggesting to them \nwhat to say and what to do. Lara participates by volunteering to do \ndifferent tasks. Rahela is silent but leads the drama work in a more \nimplicit manner by acting herself the different sequences front of her \ngroup and serving as a model for them. Moreover, as a boy takes on the \nrole of ‘Aysha’ in her group, she tells him how to say “go away” in \nBengali. Tasneen also takes great care to teach another boy how to say \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n61 \n“Leave me alone” in Bengali. They want to ‘get it right’ and make the \nscenes as authentic as possible.  \n \nSS and GD move between groups and help them with constructive \nquestions both to the children and to each other, e.g.: “ Do you think \nthat…?” They make their collaboration visible.Rahela and Lara \ncommented on watching the other groups:  \n \n“When we watch the groups acting we could understand what we had to \ndo. It helped to understand what other people were thinking about...We \ncould feel how Aysha coped in her life. It helped us understand how other \npeople treated Aysha and what she went through.” \n \nNext the children sit on the floor around SS who sits on a chair (taking \nthe role of the class teacher). \n \nArts partner SS: How many of you have had dreams at night about things \nthat happened to you in the day? What do you think could be in Aysha’s \nmemory, what would be in her dreams?  \n \nTasneen: How people treat her. What she misses from Bangladesh. \nV: What will happen to her at school. \nArts partner SS: What would be the worst moment in the playground? \nRahela: When people pushed you away \nTasneen: When they shouted go away \nC: I would be upset because the situation was making friends argue \nbetween themselves. \nE: I said it because she was in the way \nA: Gossiping about her \nB: I felt good [in the improvisation] when the two girls said do you want \nto play and the girls stuck up for her against the boys. \nM: I decided [in the improvisation] to be nice to Aysha because I wouldn’t \nwant to be in that position. \n \nArts partner SS:  Now we are going to make Aysha’s dreams. You are \ngoing to work in groups to create good and bad aspects of Aysha’s dreams. \nAnd we are going to make it look like a dream...You have to find a way to \nshow a dream. \n \nThis project starts with explicit teaching and naming of skills and techniques \n(‘starting point, working space’) followed by giving children responsibility to \nuse these to create something new (‘You have to find a way’). Children’s \nimprovisations stimulate their thinking skills and their language. They develop \ntheir knowledge and opinions by listening to peers express their views and \nresponding.  \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n62 \n \nCreating a world for writing \nIn a single term, in her literacy sessions, Teacher GD developed a complex, \nmulti-layered teaching sequence building on arts partner SS’s weekly drama \nsessions. Children worked on a variety of writing and artwork: letters, poems, \nessays, drawings, family trees and paintings of Bangladesh villages. They \nwalked through their South London estate to try to see it through the eyes of a \nnew arrival. They wrote information texts: bilingual support materials, and \nschool policies on bullying and on induction of new arrivals. They created an \nartefact from the imagined world of the novel: a ‘photo album’ of drawings \nshowing the fictional family in Bangladesh with accompanying speech bubbles \ndescribing these memories:  \n \n \n \n \n \nChildren looked at Bengali maps and children’s textbooks, and they found out \nabout Bangladesh on the internet. They were encouraged to work ‘between the \nlines’ of the novel rather than re-create its writing. They were encouraged to \nuse what they knew about the world of the novel in the context of their own \n \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n63 \nlives to create their own writing.  Work in the classroom was a series of open \npossibilities. \n \nI can hear all the drama work coming through. I can hear that you really \nknow Aysha, you know who she is, what her experiences have been, and \nthat you’re able to put yourself in her shoes. You could write about \nyourself, you know. Instead of talking about Aysha, you could put yourself \nin your own shoes. Yes, you could stand in your own shoes and you could \nwrite something that helps you to think. You could write a poem about \nyourself, thinking of all the things that you like, what you love, what you \nfeel, places you miss or where you come from. (Arts partner SS)           \n \nQuality of talk \nExtensive talk was a feature of this project, particularly in the form of \ndialogues. Children would improvise conversations between characters in the \nnovel, perform these to the class and then reflect on what they had observed \nin discussions. Dialogue was used to generate ideas and create visual \nenactments of ideas. In this observation, children in pairs develop a \nconversation that does not occur anywhere in the novel: Aysha talks with her \ngrandfather on hearing the news that her father plans to take the family to \nLondon: \n \nAbdi (as Aysha): I’m worried about going to England in case people say \nhorrid things because I’m a foreigner. \nAnthony (as Grandfather): You should go.  It is the first time you have \nseen your father in six years.  You must go… \n \nHinga:  It is difficult to leave because all my friends are here. \nBabah: Education is more important than friends… \n \nErtan: I’m nervous about going to this new modern city but I’m going to \ngo to school to learn a new language… \nOkieriete: It is time for you to join your father. \nErtan: People will be teasing me. \nOkieriete: Then you must tell your teacher… \n \nIn these improvised conversations, children used their knowledge of how to \nwork in drama, their knowledge of the world of the novel and they call on their \nown cultural and background knowledge.   \n \nThis was bringing something from them, an emotion within themselves or \nlearned within their families or friendships, not just from the story. For \nexample, we had Anthony going straight into his own grandfather, very \nstrict Nigerian grandfather, somebody wise and respected. We saw all the \ndifferent types of grandfathers. I saw we tapped a deeper level. (Teacher \nGD) \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n64 \n \nChildren were asked to imagine how Aysha would feel on hearing the news that \nshe was leaving Bangladesh. They reflected on what had been said in their \nimprovisations and how the story might continue from that point.    \n \nPriscilla was first with her hand up: She would feel unhappy.   \nSecond hand up, Rahela: She’d be heartbroken. \nNext hand up, Lara: She would be angry. \nTasneen: She would feel depressed. \nAnthony offers a different point of view: She might feel happy because of \ngoing to school. \nOkieriete: She might be worrying about not being able to speak English.  \nHinga: She might be worried whether she would make new friends. \nOkieriete: I feel like that at the moment because of going on School \nJourney. \nKym: I felt like that when I first came to this school. \nTazneen: I felt like that when I first met my cousin in Bangladesh, \nbecause she might be bad. \n \nChildren talk here in an exploratory way: She might feel…she would feel…   \nThey weave their own feelings and experiences into the discussion: I felt like \nthat…Children layer their own experiences onto the novel to interpret its \nthemes. Raney & Hollands (2000) characterise this kind of collaborative talk as \nbeing able to ‘bring us up against the gap between the self and various kinds \nof ‘otherness’...it compels us to see ourselves through others’. Teacher GD \nnoted that ‘The most reflective talk came after the drama. We underestimate \nchildren’s sophistication and their response.’   \n \nA range of writing \nChildren wrote poems in the voice of Aysha, using their knowledge of the \ncharacters and the setting of the novel and adding Bengali words for Mum, Dad, \nand Grandparents. The poems by the focus girls are particularly powerful and \ninclude specific language, religious and cultural references. They are heartfelt. \nTasneen’s poem shows that she is no longer on the margins. She expresses \nherself forcefully.   \n \nI am \nAysha, Muhammad’s favourite wife \nThat’s why I mean a lot to Dada. \n \nI am \nI don’t want to go to England...although it means I am \nKomla’s cousin, Ama’s daughter, Hussain’s cousin \nOf course, Dada, Dadi’s favourite granddaughter. \n \n \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n65 \n \nI am \nHelpful, when I peel the onions with my eyes watering. Ama tells me \nThey will bring out the flavour of the delicious curry. \n Kind, when I wash and sieve and sort the fresh, white rice and bring it to \nThe table in a hurry when people come. \n \nI love it \nWhen I climb the beautiful luscious mango trees \nOr go to the wonderful festivals called Melas. \n \nI feel like \nMy heart is sinking for Jamdher \nI don’t want to go to England but it might be fun. \n \nI hate \nThe thought of going to England \nAnd wearing grey suits like my dad. \nI am happy with my family but not with my Aba \nBecause he made me sad when he left me behind. \n \nI come from \nBangladesh \nIt means my life to me \nWhere I actually live \n \nI want to stay in Bangladesh. \n \nAs one of many in-role activities involving drama on paper, children became \nAysha’s father. They wrote to Aysha when she was four years old, explaining \nwhy he left the family to go to England. The letter was not to be opened until \nAysha was ten years old. Children called on their drama skills to assume the \nfather’s voice and to move forwards and backwards in time in their writing, \nusing expressions such as “By the time you read this….”  “ You might be asking \nyourself why I left…..”   “ It is your birthday but this is not a birthday card…it \nis to tell you why I left…” Rahela included the Bengali ABC in her letter \nreminding Aysha that it was he, her father, who taught her to read. Tasneen’s \nletter is the letter of a Muslim father to his daughter.  \n \nI’m very sorry Aysha. My heart is beating for you. Before I went I \nkissed you, I touched you and I prayed for you, and I prayed that I \nwould come very soon. Allah bless you with love. I cried my soul \nout for you my darling Aysha. It’s not bad in England, but I want to \ncome back. I could not take you and your Mother because the plane \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n66 \ntickets were very, very expensive. There are better jobs in England \nand they pay more. I left you a gift, that you can be very educated.     \n \nTasneen said to her teacher that when she wrote this letter “I could hear my \ndad speaking”.This was very sophisticated writing that referred backwards and \nforwards in time in language structure as well as in its content. The writing \nrecalls a past and imagines an unknown future. It is writing that takes place \nentirely within the world of the novel – yet it was an event that did not take \nplace in the novel. Children were reading, imagining and writing beyond the \ntext and the narrative.  \n \nChildren used the internet to search for images of Bangladesh, looking at the \nflag of Bangladesh and listening to its national anthem. They wrote essays in \npairs describing their understanding of the poem which is the national anthem \nof Bangladesh. Children adopted a very different voice and stance from their \ndramatic writing in-role. \n  \nWe understand the bit ‘My Bengal of Gold’ It means my Bengali precious \ngirl. We love the sentence ‘Your skies and your air set my heart in tune \nas if I was a flute’. We think that is a wonderful sentence. We think that \nDr. Ali Ashan writes some beautiful Bangladeshi poems. This poem sounds \njoyful and strong, powerful. It sounds like he is writing to his mum or \nwife.(Rahela and Lara) \n \nBy the end of the term, children had written in sixteen different modes around \nthe themes of the novel.  Arts partner SS and Teacher GD observed that drama \nwas more than a ‘rehearsal’ for children’s writing. SS noted that drama \n‘enabled children to inhabit a world where writing would normally take \nplace’. They discussed this in a taped reflective conversation towards the end \nof the project: \n \n In fact, none of their writing was replicated from the drama. Every letter, \nevery piece of writing, was individual. That writing was never ‘rehearsed’. \nDrama created a world out of which writing can arise....Drama allowed \nthem to be more fully themselves, in their thoughts. This drama is not \nabout pretending to be someone else. (Arts partner SS) \n \n They did constantly use references to the book… They knew ‘Aysha’, they \nknew who she was. Though her, they could discover all these common \nexperiences they had. (Teacher GD)   \n \n They had common reference points, and that was important for the class \nin order for them to move forward. Those common reference points can \nbe very elusive in classes where children come from such different \nbackgrounds. (Arts partner SS) \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n67 \n \n \nChanges for children \nTeacher GD closely involved the class Learning Support Assistant (LSA) in \nobservation and data collection. During class discussions and drama work, the \nLSA would note (by ticking a list of class names) whenever a child raised his or \nher hand, volunteered to speak, and asked or answered a question. In this way, \nover time, Teacher GD and arts partner SS could see that the focus group of \ngirls with EAL was indeed contributing more frequently. The LSA also noticed \nthat the girls had started to voluntarily sit at the front of the class rather than \nat the edges. These separate observations by Teacher GD over one term \nshowed their growing involvement: \n \nAs SS unfolded the map of Bangladesh a buzz of excitement grew, and as \nif drawn by an invisible thread, I watched Tasneen and Rahela move \nacross the floor, closing the gap, to be completely on top of the map \nwhere they excitedly showed the class their own family villages. \nRahela came from home with words describing Aysha’s [the novel’s] \ncharacter written in Bengali as well as English and her brother had made \nan A3 banner with ‘Bangladesh’ written in Bengali for the class.   \nBefore school began SS and I were in the classroom showing each other \nthe Bengali artefacts we had collected.  Tasneen and Rahela slipped into \nthe classroom early and were handling everything as it appeared from the \nbag, telling us the proper names and offering to demonstrate how to \nwear a sari. Lara was with them grinning and joining in. They were \nboisterous and confident, behaving in a delightfully cheeky way that gave \nevidence to their emerging self-assurance.  \n \nAs arts partner SS picked up the Bengali Alphabet book Rahela called out \n“I can read that”.  “So can I” added Tasneen.  They sat in the \nstoryteller’s chair and read the book to us in Bengali and English, \nreceiving a huge clap. \n \nOutcomes: exploring identity \nTeacher GD and arts partner SS observed how work in drama around the novel \ngenerated a very deep response from many children by calling on their \nexperiences as ethnic minorities in England. But they also noted that white \nBritish children in the class who had never been away from the inner city \nestate of the school also wrote compellingly as and about Aysha and \nBangladesh. The explorations of the novel created a context where all children \nfelt comfortable bringing their heritage to school.  \n \n We were collecting names for granddad, grandma, mum and dad, cousin \nand uncle, in Mandarin, Spanish, Yoruba, Arabic, Twi and many other \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n68 \nlanguages.  We had a fascinating discussion about the role of “Big Aunty” in \nNigerian society. (Teacher GD) \n \nChildren used drama to move in and out of the fictional world of the book, \nenacting and then responding as readers and writers who had their own unique \nexperiences.  \n \nThe children’s feelings of identity are subtle and complex.  This was \ndemonstrated during the football world cup where we had great times in \nfront of the TV cheering and singing for England, Nigeria, Turkey or any of \nthe other countries to which the children feel a relationship.  Our children \nhappily move between identities with similar loyalty, but their knowledge \nand experience of the hurtful aspects of this is profound. (Teacher GD) \n \nTeacher GD and arts partner SS observed how work in drama allowed children \nto slow down the narrative drive of the novel. Drama enabled children to \ndevelop pauses in the narrative, where interior life and thinking flourish.  \n  \nI was aiming to enable them to bring to the imaginary world of the novel \nthings they had experienced that were similar, things they understood \nfrom their real world... The class brings a whole set of background \nknowledge to what they’re doing. In all the sessions, we never did \nanything to do with the narrative.  We went somewhere else: the world \naround ‘Aysha’, not the past tense of narrative. Narrative is about the \n‘there and then’ Drama is about the ‘here and now’. It was a lived \nexperience.(Arts partner SS)  \n \nThe effect on the focus group of girls was profound.  \n \nI learned that Aysha’s life is very horrible and I don’t want my life to be \nlike that. That’s how well I know how Aysha feels when she came to \nEngland.  It is the first time I have included my life in Aysha’s. I would \ncompare my life with somebody else’s to understand what Aysha’s life is \nlike. (Tasneen) \n \nTasneen told me, ‘When I’m acting, I’m not shy anymore.’ It gave her a \n‘cover’...[the focus girls] had misplaced their words. Those cultural \nreferences were like smelling the madeleine, they found their \nwords...Nothing was aimed at those particular EAL children. We created a \ncontext... We saw a big change in those girls. Their relationships with the \nclass grew, they were much more jokey and confident. Before they were \nmuch more on the sidelines. They felt so free to make cultural references \nin their writing and in class discussions. They felt more comfortable. \n(Teacher GD) \n \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n69 \nThey’re ‘out’ about being Bengali or Bangladeshi. They could include \ntheir culture. They know things. We may be holding the reins of the \nclassroom but it also puts us in a learning situation. (Arts partner SS) \n \nThe teacher and arts partner were firmly in control of the classroom. They \nknew what the learning intention was. But the project also enabled them to \nlearn more about the children. Arts partner SS and Teacher GD characterised \nthe project as ‘using what the children know’, and ‘children bringing their \nexperiences to the curriculum’. This was made possible in a process-orientated \ncreative arts project where the teacher and the arts partner had a shared view \nof children and their learning.        \n  \n \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n70 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Class Study Two: Questioning and reflecting   \n \n  Year 6 in School D  \n  Teacher AH \n  Arts Organisations Y and O \n  A 3-term theatre/performing arts project \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n71 \n \nContext \nSchool D is a one-form entry school in a purpose-built building behind a major \nrail station. The experienced senior management team encourage teachers to \ntake children out of the school to museums, theatres, cinemas and other \ncultural centres all within walking distance of the school.  \n \nTeacher AH was in his second year of teaching and had previously trained and \nworked as an actor. Like Teacher GD, although much less experienced, Teacher \nAH brought his own background, skills and interests to his teaching. \nTeacher AH and his class had a relationship with cultural and performing arts \ninstitutions rather than an individual arts partner who came into the class each \nweek. Their main, ongoing relationship was with Theatre Y. \n \nThe arts institutions offered a number of experiences: repeated access to \nperformances, visit from directors, singers and composers, in-school and on-\nstage workshops. In a session at Theatre Y, children produced the opening \nscenes of the play Skellig (based on the novel by David Almond), taking on all \nthe on-stage and back-stage roles (in sound, lighting and cueing) with adult \nsupervision. Children created props for the play Skellig which were used in the \nprofessional performances. Children also performed a short play as part of a \nschools performance series and made a documentary film about Theatre Y \nbased on their own research.  \n \nTeacher AH’s planning was flexible and he was able to integrate the \nexperiences offered by the institutions, although he was not always sure what \nwould happen in the sessions. The institutions did not engage with what was \ngoing on inside Teacher AH’s classroom. As Theatre Y’s education director SE \nput it: ‘What we brought to the table was our expertise.’  She did however \nbelieve that the theatre gained from opening its doors and backstage to the \nclass over three terms, and that the children ‘gave us a meaningful and \nmemorable experience of this theatre’ by reflecting the institution back to its \npractitioners and staff.  \n \nAims \nTeacher AH was interested in children’s questions. He observed that his class \nrarely asked any questions and the few questions they did ask were closed, \nrequiring simple ‘yes’ or ‘no’ answers. He wanted to find out whether exposure \nto and reflection on theatre arts experiences could develop children’s enquiry \nand critical thinking skills.  \n \nTeacher AH used the opportunities of the performing arts workshops and visits \nto encourage children to ask questions. Through developing their questioning, \nTeacher AH hoped that children would become more willing to write because \nthey would have gained information and insights. He hoped that they would \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n72 \nfeel more confident about writing because the theatre arts experiences would \ngive them something to write about.  \n \nTeacher AH tracked the progress of a boy and a girl, Kieron and Nadeen. He \nobserved that these young people were writing as little as possible, just enough \nto satisfy teacher requirements for class work. Teacher AH was concerned \nabout Kieron in particular who would weep in frustration and anxiety whenever \nTeacher AH asked him to write anything.  Teacher AH wanted to help children \nlike Nadeen and Kieron prepare for their new secondary schools. He wanted \nthem to develop independence, enthusiasms and interests, to be motivated to \nfind things out and express themselves more freely.  \n \nProject work: Becoming knowledgeable \nTeacher AH observed that in performing arts workshops the adult professionals \ntreated children as if they too were adult learners. He commented after the \nworkshop at Theatre Y, in which children produced the opening scene of \nSkellig, that the children “were the real people in the real theatre doing the \nreal jobs. They had some real-life experiences.” One boy, Mohammed, \ncommented to Teacher AH that ‘I might be a sound man one day.’  \n \n They treat us like adults. In the technical work they treated us like \nwe’ve already done the job, like we know what to do. (Nadeen) \n \nThey treat us like we are all like them. (Kieron) \n \nTeacher AH observed that children were intrigued by the ways in which the \nperforming arts practitioners described their lives. After watching a \nperformance at Theatre Y, children had a question and answer session with \nactors who used a vocabulary of excitement, hard work and intrinsic rewards: \n \n- If you work really hard, you get a good play like this one \n- It’s hard work but it’s a rewarding job \n- If you have ‘nerves’ it makes for good work \n- It can be scary and tiring \n- It’s like being paid to play \n- It’s amazing, changing all the time \n \nTheatre Y’s workshops provided some of the explicit teaching in skills and \nlanguage that individual arts partners provided in other project classrooms. \nLater in the school year when children visited an opera house, they already \nknew the types of work and roles they might find there: \n \nTeacher AH: What jobs can you think of that you won’t see on stage? \n \nChildren: Conductor, director, lights, cue person, prompter, sound \npeople. \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n73 \n \nTeacher AH: What would you like to find out?  \n \nPaulina: How long do you rehearse it, how long did you practise for your \nvoice to become like that? \n \nTeacher AH explicitly modelled questioning and responding in the context of \nthe theatre arts experiences. After children had seen and heard a short opera, \nTeacher AH asked them questions about the plot, the characters and what they \nthought about it as a production. He also tried to help children see connections \nbetween their different theatre arts experiences.    \n \nTeacher AH: There are two types of questions, listen for the differences: \n(1) Where did the Chef [in the opera] hide the ring? \n(2) How did you think the mirror was effective? \nHow are they different? \n \nSharon: The first one you can say: ‘the cake’. The second one you give \nmore information. \n \nSorcha: The first one you need to find out, to remember and think back. \nThe second one is about how did you think, not finding out. \n \nTeacher AH: Which one could be right or wrong? Which one makes you \nthink more? \n \nAlejandro: The second one, because you have to think what you thought. \nYou have to give your opinion.   \n \nTeacher AH: What did you find out about the character of the Chef in the \nopera? \nPaulina; He looked clumsy \nKieron: He was sweating a lot. \nTeacher AH: Why do you think that was? \nSharon: He was the mad one \nTeacher AH: Yes, he was hectic. \nJake: He was on the stage more, the lights were in his face \nNadeen: And because of his hat. \nTeacher AH: You have experienced that yourselves at the theatre when \nyou performed there and also in the workshop when some of you went up \ninto the lights.   \n \nTeacher AH made explicit to children what constitutes good questions (Which \none makes you think more?) and children began to understand what constitute \nadequate answers (To remember and think back…you have to give your \nopinion). He drew their attention to the ways in which his questioning elicited \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n74 \ndifferent types of information or responses. Teacher AH encouraged children to \nreflect on their experiences through their questioning. \n \nQuality of talk: creating conditions for writing \nTeacher AH linked children’s questions and discussions to writing tasks. Within \na broad topic, Teacher A often gave children choices about how and what to \nwrite, calling on their background knowledge of books, television or other \nexperiences, as in this observation following a science visit of animals to \nschool:      \n  \nTeacher AH: You can write a story about animals as characters, using the \ninformation that we learned today, or you can write an information page. \nLots of different writing you could do. Can you think of books or stories \nwhere animals talk?  \n[The children quickly come up with: Anthony Browne, Wind in the \nWillows, Hodgheg, Brian Jacks, Dick King-Smith.] \nCarl: What film has a talking animal? The pig one, ‘Babe’. \nDanny: I’m thinking of one, its not a book, it’s on the telly after school. \n[The cartoon] ‘Arthur’. \n \nBefore Emmanuel and Glory begin to write, they take on the role of \nTeacher AH, asking each other questions and discussing what might be in \ntheir stories.  \n \n (E) OK, so what is our first headline, this is how it starts – what’s the \ntitle?  \n(G) The three wise birds, and their enemies \n(E) That’s too much like a comic – shall we think of it when we finish? \nShall we give them names? How many boys, one girl? Nicknames? \n(G) One day in the Andes mountain, a chinchilla... \n(E) Yeah! Come on, let’s start then!  \n(G) A mouse, a hedgehog, lived in a family, a mouse called \n(E) Forget Sonic, for now.  \n(they each start to write) \n(E) Build up the suspense – today, tragically.  \n \nIt was notable that this class actively enjoyed writing in the ‘adult education’ \nmodel of the writing workshop: they had many opportunities to write about \nthings that interested them personally, and they could talk and collaborate as \nwell as write independently. Their work was in ‘writing journals’ (a personal \nwriting book) rather than ‘literacy books’ (a school writing book). The journals \nwere decorated with pictures of rappers, Indian film stars and children’s own \nartwork. Children often chose to write about their lives outside of school, but \nthey increasingly wrote about their performing arts experiences in factual and \nimaginative modes.     \n \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n75 \n \nWhat [seeing the play] Skellig Made Me Feel \nIt was a sunny day and I woke up in a lovely Barbados day. I gazed into \nthe golden sun laced with crystals reflecting into the water. I felt warm \ninside my heart. It was the most gorgeous day of my life. Later on that \nday I ran across a smooth but I thick hot sand. I felt like I was in heaven. \nThen it happened. I saw him, Skellig. When I saw him I felt weird, \nsomething I’ve never felt before. It was the weirdest thing in my life. \n(Emmanuel) \n \nWhat I did at the Theatre \nWhen I went to the theatre we did a workshop, we acted and did the \nsound and others did the acting. Ben and I were doing the lighting. You \nhad to be tall to control the light. It was really fun when I had the \nheadset on. I had to wait for Paula to say ‘Follow spot two, standby!’ \nThen I had to say ‘Standing-by!’, then Pauline would go and I would turn \non my follow light. I would like to do that when I’m older.  At first it was \nhard then it got easier. My arm started to hurt when I was holding the \nlight.     \n(Sorcha)      \n \nThrough their experiences and their collaborative talk, children developed \nenthusiasm for writing. They began to write at length and for longer periods of \ntime (up to an hour and a half in one observation). This type of writing \ndevelopment has been observed in other classroom contexts (Safford, \nO’Sullivan and Barrs, 2004): where children write daily about something that \ninterests them, they also increase their stamina for writing and their \ntranscription improves. \n \nWriting in role: a chorus of voices \nFollowing their visit to an opera house to see a live performance of a short \nopera (Bake for One Hour), Teacher AH directed children to write in role as one \nof the opera’s three characters: the Chef, the Maid or the Hostess. Before \nwriting, children recalled and discussed the plot, in which the three singers vie \nfor a magical ring. They reviewed the scenarios, music and characters. They \nrecalled the in-school workshop where they learned the story of the opera, \nenacted it themselves, and sang the chorus. Children talked about how the \nexperience of enactment told them what to expect when they saw and heard \nthe real opera. They were able to internalise the opera story and make it \nmeaningful to themselves. They were also able to step momentarily into the \nshoes of the singers.  \n \nGlory: I liked it when we done the singing, we got to have a go instead of \njust listening. \n \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n76 \nSorcha: I liked making the still images [creating freeze frames], it tells us \nwhen we go to see the opera, we know what it’s about. \n \nJack: Me & Billy liked the part when we did [made the shape of] the \nmirror. You work together to make one big structure, and we got to \nspeak… it told me what to expect. \n \nChildren’s individual writing takes on the voice of each character. The writing \nreflects the pace and urgency of the short opera in which the three characters \ncompete for the magical ring.  Words and sentences repeat musically as \nchildren recall the tunes, rhythms and libretto of the opera. Read together, \nchildren’s individual writing becomes a musical trio, the staccato voice of the \nChef contrasting with the fluid voices of the Maid and Hostess.      \n \nI have fallen madly in love with the Chef, but unfortunately he does not \nlove me back. I need the ring, the gold shining ring that the hostess \nhas...I am going to steal it, steal the ring from the hostess.  \n(Nadeen as the Maid) \n \nNow the ring is within my grasp. I feel its shiny surface. Guilt and fear \nare running in my veins...I run down the stairs with the ring clutched in \nmy hand. I am sweating. \n(Sorcha as the Hostess) \n \nOh no! This is not going as planned. Oh! I don’t know how I’ll get the ring. \nI’ll put it in the cake, it’s marvellous... My lady don’t take a slice!  \n(Kieron as the Chef)  \n  \nIn this writing children call on their experiences as an audience, seeing and \nhearing the opera itself, the live singers and musicians. Their writing shows \nthat they have been an attentive audience; their listening skills are evident. \nThey see and hear the opera in their heads as they write.  \n \nIn their writing they have also become performers, calling on their \nparticipatory workshop experiences. They have taken on the voices of \ncharacters musically in words, tempo and cadence. Their imaginative \nengagement in the plot, the language and the music is strong, as is their grasp \nof the thoughts and voices of the characters.  \n \nChanges for children \nOver three terms Teacher AH found that children’s questioning did become \nmore frequent and more open, and that the very act of going outside school to \ncultural institutions was a significant factor in this change. These out-of-school, \nin-the-world experiences made children curious. The experiences also engaged \nchildren in the real-life uses of literacy and gave voice to some of their \naspirations. The experiences also influenced their attitudes to writing. \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n77 \n \nI want to be a footballer. But if I’m not a footballer I would go to the \ntheatre and be a stage manager, not an actor. I would be managing the \nlights or the sound, be a technician. There’s a computer, you press an \narrow and the lights go on, on a spot on the stage…  Sometimes you might \nwant to write something but you can’t because you don’t know what to \nwrite. If you’ve been somewhere like the opera, even if it was two \nmonths ago, you can still write about it. You may never go to the opera \nagain, but at least you can write about it. (Kieron) \n \nIt changed my writing because I used to write what came into my head. \nWhen I went to the opera and the theatre, now, I can think about that \nand write about that. (Nadeen) \n \nNadeen’s last piece of writing before she left primary school was a five-page \nstory written in sustained role, in the voice of a girl evacuated from London \nduring the Blitz. Drawing on her history learning, Nadeen gets right inside the \nsituation, imagining in great detail how it would have been to be an evacuee. \n \nI kissed my family and said goodbye. Then father took me to the train \nstation, and I saw millions of children being evacuated like me. When I \ngot on the train, I kissed father and said goodbye once more, then the \ntrain started to move. Father walked away and waved at me and I waved \nback. Then as the train got faster I wouldn’t see father anymore.  \n \nI sat back on my seat and I saw a boy colouring in a book. Then I got my \nbook out that Geoff gave me. When I started to read it, I felt sad but I \ndidn’t cry. I don’t know how to cry. When I looked out the window, I felt \nsick. Then I went to sleep.   \n \nNadeen is beginning to take her writing seriously. Through repeated access to a \n‘writing workshop’ in school, she has developed stamina for writing at length. \nShe uses her previous experiences in performing arts workshops and enactment \nto step into the world of the evacuee. She creates a sombre setting, mood and \nvoice in her story. She creates a pause in the narrative action (and changes \ntense to indicate this) to think and reflect (I don’t know how to cry).   \n \nOutcomes: reasons to be literate \nAt the end of the three-term project, children made a short documentary film \nabout the history of Theatre Y. The film was the culmination of the class’s \nyear-long relationship with the theatre and its staff. It was also a testament to \nthe quality of children’s questions.  \n \nThe film was a research project, a local history project, and a portrait of the \ntheatre itself. It was a multimodal, collaborative information text. The children \ndecided what questions they wanted to ask and to whom. They began with a \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n78 \nlong list of questions which they pruned and refined. They interviewed actors, \ntechnicians, directors and local residents.  \n \nIn the film children demonstrate their skills of inquiry. They demonstrate their \nskills in collaboration and knowledge of the theatre. They understand that the \nfilm is intended to help an audience find out about the theatre.  \n \nChildren did not learn filmmaking to make this film. It was shot and edited by \nprofessionals. There was a distinct separation between the skills of filmmaking \nand the skills of research and inquiry. Children’s work was communicated \nthrough the mode of film, and high professional standards lifted their work to a \nnew level.  The film was presented in the theatre and also on a national \ntelevision channel. It is used by Theatre Y for fundraising. The children’s work \nis doing a real job in the real world. It exists and has value outside of school. \n \nAt a public screening of the film, children responded to questions from an \naudience. Their own answers echo the messages they had heard from \nperforming arts professionals. The children had become experts. They could \nsee themselves in professional roles and they had worked effectively in groups \nto make a documentary film. They saw the theatre as a permanent part of their \nlives. \n \n(Do any of you want to work in theatre, become directors, actors, now?) \nSorcha: I’d like to be a director \nEmmanuel: I’d like to be an actor, but in the cinema. \n \n(What is your favourite place in the theatre?) \nEmmanuel: The auditorium. It’s big, it always changes. \n \n(When you’ve grown up will you bring your kids here?) \nDanny: Yes, for sure \n \n(How many times did you do your speaking parts?)  \nDanny:  In our groups we agreed what was relevant. \nEmmanuel: We did only one ‘take’. \n \n       (What have you learned about the theatre?)  \nSorcha: If you want to do a play, you can’t just do it in one day. You need \na year, more than a year. Hard work. The hardest thing is coming up with \nthe ideas and how it’s going to work...You can have a hundred people and \nless than half of them will be actors.  \n \nThe energy of the performing arts experiences was profound. Teacher AH said \nthat ‘it affected everything.’ Children became aware of artistic communities \non the school’s doorstep. They learned about practice and rehearsal, and the \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n79 \nlong process of becoming an expert. As they shadowed and learned about roles \nin cultural institutions they became aware of lives and opportunities beyond \nschool. They became active participants in theatre arts and learned how to be \nan active audience of theatre arts.   \n \nThrough their teacher’s focus on questioning and reflective talk in the context \nof these experiences, children became more experienced and able to respond \nboth orally and in writing. Children’s scores in statutory writing tests (SATs) \nrose, in some cases dramatically (appendix 3). Teacher AH’s only preparation \nfor these tests was to discuss with children the kinds of questions they might \nencounter: ‘In SATs you get more points when you answer the and why part of \nthe question…you get more points when you say why’. He attributed the \nimproved attainment scores to the children feeling prepared to write: ‘They \nweren’t nervous about it. They were confident as writers and felt they had \nsomething to say ’. \n \n \n \n \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n80 \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  Class Study Three: Multimedia experiences  \n    \n   Year 4 in School F \n   Teacher MK, arts partner TM \n   A two-term multi-media project \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n81 \n \nContext  \nSchool F is a two-form entry school in a large Victorian-era building, in a mixed \nneighbourhood of private housing and estates that includes a large middle-class \ncontingent. The experienced headteacher supports community and creative \narts projects throughout the school. \n \nTeacher MK was in her seventh year of teaching. Arts partner TM had previously \nworked in School EW and with this particular class. TM was sensitive to the \npressures on teachers and tried to work in ways that supported their individual \nclassroom practice. \n \nI try to suit the teaching style and practice of each teacher I work with. A \npartnership has to work for the teacher. The benefits may be one to two \nyears later. Little seeds planted. (Arts partner TM)  \n \nTeacher MK and arts partner TM began by observing one another teach the \nclass. This gave them a ‘feeling’ for each other and allowed children to see the \narts partner TM in the role of their teacher. Teacher MK also visited arts \npartner TM’s studio.  Like Teacher GD and arts partner SS in Class Study One \n(and Teacher KR and arts partner NB in Class Study Four) this was a partnership \nof close and constant communication.  \n \nAims \nThe aim of this project was broad: to inspire reluctant writers to write through \na multi-sensory approach. Children had a series of workshops where they \nexplored their five senses and made different kinds of art in response to \ntouching, tasting, smelling, listening and seeing. They used the Photoshop \ncomputer programme to visually manipulate their artwork and created a series \nof images on-screen. They wrote stories to accompany these images. Teacher \nMK admitted in retrospect that the project was too ambitious.  \n \nWe had a big picture of what was going to happen, and each week it got \nsmaller and smaller! And it really taught us that you can’t go on with too \nmany ideas. (Teacher MK) \n   \nTeacher MK tracked the progress of Amina in the context of whole class work. \nAmina had recently arrived from Somalia and struggled with written work \nalthough she was becoming more confident in speaking.  \n \nProject work: multi-sensory workshops \nIn five separate sessions children responded to a sensory experience (sound, \ntaste, smell, sight and touch) by quickly making a piece of artwork (drawing, \ncollage, clay, pastel, chalk). The sessions were intended to be spontaneous and \nfree.   \n \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n82 \nChildren are so responsive. They can ‘be’ the colour. It is about linking and \nengaging with the world around them, raising their physical awareness of \nthe world and their ability to articulate that and express it visually with as \nfew blocks and filters as possible. (Arts partner TM) \n \nChildren enjoyed these spontaneous art-making activities. They kept \nsketchbooks of some of their initial responses and drawings which they were \nable to explain to the research team. Looking at the sketchbooks, children \nrecalled vividly the sensory workshops and their thoughts in those moments:   \n \nWe closed our eyes...you make up in your mind what you can see. I can \nhear, I can smell, use all your senses. We did a drawing of what we \nthought it would look like. When I touched the feathers, I imagined an \nostrich, and I was running in the Amazon desert trying to frighten these \nsnakes that were strangling me and suddenly this ostrich came and \nstarted chasing me. I slipped down a hole and fell into a temple and the \nostrich killed all the snakes and killed me. That’s just one of the things I \nmade up when I was doing the ‘feeling’. (Tashi) \n \nAfter these sensory workshops, Teacher MK sometimes asked children for a \nbrief written response. Amina wrote about the landscape she imagined during a \nworkshop exploring the sense of sound: \n \nThe sun beamed on the bright green grass.  I saw the wind push the wavy \ngrass out the way and I could see a peaceful tree resting on the grass.  \nThere was a calm slow sound.  The wind was blowing really hard.  Then it \nstarted to go creepier by the minute, there was a crazy beat under the \nground.  A buzzing sound was coming from somewhere.  The music was \nechoing through the land.  The land was getting dark.  The only tree was \ndrifting away.  There was a big river it looked colossal and warm.  But \nsomething separated the mountains from the sun, it was the clouds.  It \nwas windy and I could feel the breeze     (unfinished by Amina)   \n \nThis response-writing was intended as preparation for children’s final stories, \nwhich were called Sense Stories. However, children did not appear to know \nwhere the project was going and where and how their writing fit into the art-\nmaking. Teacher MK and arts partner TM realised they had ‘overloaded’ \nchildren with ideas and concepts.  \n \nWe found we didn’t really have a clear structure, so at times we were \nover-saturating the children, which created confusion. (Teacher MK)      \n \nThe result of this ‘over-loading’ was that the ultimate focus of the project was \nthe computer programme, where artwork seemed to dominate writing. \n \n \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n83 \nMultimodal texts  \nArts partner TM photographed the children’s artwork and put the images into \nthe Photoshop computer programme. Children were then taught how to \nmanipulate images of their artwork in Photoshop to create a series of imaginary \nlandscapes on-screen. Photographs of the children themselves in a drama \nsession exploring their imaginary landscapes were added to the computer \nimages. An imaginary character drawn by each child was also introduced into \ntheir digital landscapes.  \n \nUsing Photoshop, children created a series of images that brought together \ntheir artwork, photographs of themselves and their imaginary character. They \ncreated storyboards consisting of four or five different frames. From these \nstoryboards children wrote short narratives of their adventures in the imaginary \nlandscapes. The stories and images were put into the Powerpoint programme to \ncreate multimedia presentations that included electronic music. Children \npresented their Sense Stories to the school and to parents, reading their stories \naloud with a microphone to the series of image-and-text slides with sound.    \n \nChildren owned these stories completely: every word and image was made by \nthem. Children were in their Sense Stories not only as the first person narrator \nbut as images of themselves. They could literally see themselves in their \nstories. They manipulated the text as well as the images, making words float, \nfade or zoom in and out of powerpoint slides. \n \nI started with me.  I thought, why not do something adventurous? It could \nbe me wandering off in the jungle... Because it was me, I was in it. I \nthought if I was in it, it would be much more better. I liked the pictures I \ndid. I never knew it was going to turn out like this. It’s like a mystery \nstory. It makes you want to read it. (Amina) \n \nThe stories all follow a similar structure: children are in a fantasy landscape \nand they meet a strange character. They are simple narratives without \ncharacter development or inner psychological action. The stories are written in \nthe first person, referring to the photographs of the children themselves and to \ntheir artwork.  \n   \n                 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI was lost in a unknown world. It was baking hot and I \nwas digging up the earth searching for hidden treasure. \nI found a fossil of a fish and a gigantic whale. \n \nThe giant tried to come after me but the rocks closed up \nand pressed against him.  I felt sad with fear but I kept  \nrunning.  I spun round and I saw he was trapped, now I felt \nsafe.\n \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n84 \nQuality of talk: confidence and recall  \nChildren in this project were able to recall the physical explorations in \nworkshops and how these helped get ideas for writing. They were able to \nexplain their work to adults confidently.  \n  \nCLPE: Where did you get your ideas for your story? \n \nTom: From all the pictures that we done and all the music we listened to. \nIt really helped using all your senses, because all your senses could \nexplore it and it was easier. You could imagine in your eyes, imagine in \nyour smell and your hearing and your touch. \n \nChildren used their sketchbooks to recall the sensory workshops in detail.  \n \nWhen you put your hand in the box, you had to describe what you thought \nit was, and draw it. I could feel like slimy stuff, and [arts partner] T said \nyou had to draw it as you felt it. As you felt it, draw it down. [Points] \nThis is when the tastes was coming on, and the taste was nasty and so I \nput myself in angry.... I tasted angry stuff and I saw dinosaurs. (Jordan, \nlooking at his sketchbook)  \n \nChildren demonstrated a sophisticated visual sense and a strong sense of on- \nscreen composition as they played with the Photoshop programme. But the \ncomputerised artwork seemed to dominate the storytelling. Children were \nmore enthusiastic talking about their images than their writing.  \n \nTom: It was the feeling I had to inspire what I felt. I drawed the \nSmellman. \nCLPE: What were you feeling? \nTom: It was kind of like a weight thing. Then I drawed the Ten Chin \nthing. Then I done the background. Then I done the clay aliens around. \nThey want to talk to me. [Points] That [round shape] was in the [feely] \nbox and I felt it. \nCLPE: What was your story? \nTom: I can’t really remember. I wrote it down and it’s in my literacy \nbook. I done the background people blue the same as me, because it links \nto me. \n \nWriting the stories – in children’s minds – continued to be associated with \n‘literacy’, a domain the artwork seemed to bypass. Tom has a story in his \nartwork, but his writing has disappeared into a literacy folder. Children’s ideas \nfor artwork were in their sketchbooks, which they could readily access and \ndiscuss. Their writing was in their ‘literacy books’ and, once there, it seemed \nto be forgotten. Children expressed more personal investment and satisfaction \nin their images than in their writing.  \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n85 \n \nForm trumps content? \nThe Sense Stories look and sound impressive. The presentational aspect is \nstrong. Children were proud of their productions. They asked teacher MK to \nkeep the stories saved on the school computers so they could re-view them \nwhenever they were in the computer suite.     \n \nBut the Sense Stories have a potential that is not quite fully realised. Teacher \nMK noted that children enjoyed manipulating their artwork, and their images \nare stronger than their writing. The artwork is individual, quirky, playful and \nvaried. Yet the writing is all very similar: a landscape is introduced, the \nnarrator meets a character. The stories all have the same title. Children were \nconstrained in their writing to the four or five powerpoint frames and confined \nto the small space of text boxes. They had to complete their narratives within \na narrow structure. There are no pauses in the quick-fire narratives, no inner \naction or sense of the characters. Some children said they would have written \nmore. \n \nI would have added more pictures and more writing to go with it, so it \nwouldn’t be just him trapped in the rocks – he would get out and come \nafter me again. He comes from inside the sea...I was thinking if I ever got \nin a situation like that when I was older, I would go home and think about \nit and write a story again... If we done a lot more, I would have stuck \nwith this, got him out of the way and then started making it like Lara \nCroft. (Jordan) \n \nTeacher MK acknowledged that ‘Their Playstation experiences were in this’ but \nthese experiences were not explicitly called-upon in making the Sense Stories. \nChildren had a series of stimuli rather than fully-explored experiences and \nTeacher MK admitted that children’s writing, which came last on the end of all \nthe sensory and computer workshops, was not adequately developed.     \n \nThe writing was lovely, but we didn’t have time to re-draft it, think \nabout our thoughts clearly, where it was going. I would have got more \nwriting. The writing was the hardest part because they didn’t know \nwhere we were going with it. To put words to a picture, they really \ndidn’t understand that. (Teacher MK) \n \nTeacher MK said the children would have benefited from more time to develop \nthe kinds of work they had begun, in art-making, in computer technology and in \nwriting.  \n \nChanges for children \nTeacher MK felt that a multi-sensory approach did inspire reluctant writers to \nwrite. She observed children like Amina improve their writing in quantity and \nsometimes in quality sparked by the sensory workshops, making artwork and \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n86 \nworking with computer programme. Teacher MK also observed that the project \ninspired children to share and present and share their writing.      \n \nThey all felt like they had succeeded. I have children now who want to \nread out and share their writing who never wanted to before….I’ve \nlooked at their work [writing] since then, they’ve brought it to show me, \nand it’s been really impressive...The ownership was quite big. It’s still on \nthe computers in the suite. (Teacher MK) \n \nChildren were universally enthusiastic about this project. They attributed a \nwide range of learning to their work with arts partner TM.   \n \nThe impact that it’s given me is quite big. All the ideas that [arts \npartner] T gave I used in what I did. If we do the project again, my \nstories will be really good, my typing will be really good, my computer \nskills will be really good. And all my artwork will be much better. \n(Tashi) \n \nChildren enjoyed the spontaneity of the project.    \n \nI had permission to be weird. (Issaka) \n \nThe school’s headteacher agreed:  \n \nIt was anarchic – good! It was an exploration. You didn’t know where it \nwas going – good, that was good! We need more of that. (Headteacher GJ) \n \nTeacher MK observed (somewhat ruefully) that children enjoyed the project \nbecause it was “different to normal school work” but that she was trying to \nensure that there wasn’t such a difference to her classroom teaching. \n \nDoing this project has taught me that there doesn’t have to be a \ngap...I’m open to new ideas. It’s opened me up a lot more, thinking \ncreatively about children, children as learners. We can’t just expect \nchildren to learn in one style. They need to be practical and hands-on. \n(Teacher MK) \n      \nOutcomes: space to respond and play \nIn this project children worked spontaneously and played with media and \nmaterials. The work crossed subject boundaries by merging art, ICT and \nliteracy.  Digital work dominated the project, and it also motivated the \nchildren.  \n \n \n \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n87 \nIt comes alive for the kids when they’re on the computer...and its good \nfor them to be computer literate, that’s the way the world is \ngoing...They liked that the most: getting on the computers and being able \nto fiddle with it and manipulate it. It was the artwork they were playing \nwith, making it more creative and special...It was a nice way to work, \nrather than making them sit down and write something. …They were \nallowed to be free. That was important. If we can take risks, children see \nthat they can take risks as well... They were making all the decisions. It \nwasn’t us saying, ‘you have to have this in it’. It was all their stuff...I \nquite liked the idea of risk-taking, going with what the children gave us. \n(Teacher MK) \n \nThis project was seen as ‘weird’, ‘risk-taking’ and even ‘anarchic’ in the \ncontext of the primary school curriculum, where learning outcomes may often \nbe established and made explicit before lessons begin. The extent to which the \nproject was perceived as beyond curriculum parameters is evidence of the lack \nof free space to play and experiment in the primary school - space which may \nbe reclaimed in creative arts projects.        \n \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n88 \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  Class Study Four: The stories you want to tell \n    \n   Year 5 in School A \n   Teacher KR, arts partner NB \n   A 3-term filmmaking project \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n89 \n \nContext  \nSchool A is a multiethnic 3-form entry school in a large, Victorian-era building. \nAt the time of the research it was in the lowest band of attainment in its \neducation authority. The number on roll dropped sharply when local authority \nhousing was sold and families were re-housed elsewhere. The number of \nchildren in teacher KR’s class declined to 18 by the end of the school year. \n \nThe filmmaking project existed in isolation from the rest of the school, which \nstreamed and set children by ability in the core subjects (literacy, numeracy \nand science). Teacher KR was not able to develop and extend children’s work \nsimply because she lacked contact with them. They were taught literacy by \nother teachers in ability sets. Teacher KR worked with them as a whole class in \nthe non-core, foundation subjects and got permission from the headteacher to \ncarry out the filmmaking project in lieu of other curriculum work.  \n \nAs this partnership finished, the headteacher resigned and all creative \nprogrammes were abandoned in favour of a push for academic attainment. \nTeacher KR, who was in her 5th year of teaching, left the school at the end of \nthe partnership year. There was no continuation of this creative arts project \nand no continuity for the children who participated in it. However it did \ndemonstrate that creative arts projects can and do flourish – at least \ntemporarily - in adverse circumstances.     \n \nDespite the challenging school context, teacher and arts partner achieved a \nclose working relationship which was crucial to the success of the project. \nTeacher KR and arts partner NB were in constant contact via email and \ntelephone. After each session in school they would discuss children’s work, \nreflect on individual children’s progress and where to take the next session.   \n \nAims \nThe point of the partnership’s enquiry was to see how working in film might \nimprove children’s communication. The aim was to help children tell their \nstories through the medium of film, and this involved each partner – teacher, \nfilmmaker and children - in discovering and articulating those stories. Eliciting \nchildren’s ideas for films through drama and role-play was a significant aspect \nof the project.  In the beginning, arts partner NB observed that children’s \nability to articulate their ideas was limited:   \n \nThey are not limited as people, they are clearly not. They have a lot to \nsay when they start to find the way to say it. But it’s trying to enable \nthem to say something that maybe hasn’t been said before or that means \nsomething to them. I don’t see my job as teaching them how to make \nfilms. It’s exploring how they might tell their stories through a medium \nthey might use, such as film. (Arts partner NB)  \n \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n90 \n \nThe partnership work had three strands: technical skills and knowledge about \nfilmmaking, drama and role play, and writing. Children learned camera \ntechniques, visual shots and the meanings they may convey, sound and \nstoryboarding; they worked collaboratively in drama workshops to develop \nthemes for film stories; and they wrote in different formats (diaries, in-role, \nscript dialogues, storyboards, poems) as a preparation for writing film scripts \nand for acting in the films themselves. Children also watched professional short \nfilms to deepen their understanding of both film technique, drama and film \nstory. Each strand of work reinforced the others and came together in four \nshort films which were shown at a local cinema for the school, families and the \ncommunity.  \n \nTeacher KR observed that over three terms children enthusiastically took on \nnot only technical knowledge, skills and vocabulary of professional filmmaking, \nthey took on professional roles as well: camera, sound, writer, director, actor. \nTeacher KR also noticed that through the film project children began to \ncommunicate and negotiate more effectively, that their language in paired and \ngroup discussions had changed. This was a significant improvement because \nTeacher KR observed children’s relationships to be very poor at the start of the \nschool year. Her own notes during a drama session revealed her concerns: \n \nL, K, B and D missed the first part of the session due to a bullying \nincident at playtime. When the children were able to create a series of \nstills/freeze frames nearly all chose a violent stance involving guns, \nknives or punching. Talked about this at the end of the session. Many \nchildren said they were quite used to seeing violence on television, \nhowever a large number have also witnessed or experienced violence first \nhand...R. opted out of the whole session, claimed ‘tiredness’ but seemed \nmore likely to be intimidation or fear of embarrassment.(Teacher KR \nobservational notes) \n \n \nProject work: learning film language \nIn sessions with filmmakers, children learned the vocabulary of film (wide shot, \ntilt, close-up, cut-away, ‘cheat’) and what certain camera angles can imply \n(for example a close up often indicates a charged emotional state or thinking). \nThey watched professional films whilst following storyboards of those films, \nand in groups they created their own simple storyboard narratives using \npolaroid photographs of the class.  \n \nThe pace of these sessions was brisk. Children took on many ideas and tasks \nand the teaching was explicit. A visiting filmmaker created a storyboard using \nphotographs of the children in their classroom and he spontaneously created a \nsimple narrative to go with it. In this observation, he highlights the many \ncomponents of filmmaking:  \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n91 \n \nFilmmaker S: The boy is supposed to look angry, how does he look? Happy. \nYou have to choose the right shots, you have to act well, you have to \nprepare the actions: ‘Action!’ I could put the pictures in a different \norder. If you change the order, you change the story. This is called \nediting. Editors are special people who put together bits of film.  \n \nHe retells the story in a different order, two times. He asks the children \nto see the differences and creates a surprise ending in one version: “We \ncall that suspense”. \n \nThe children notice discrepancies: ‘The teacher is marking a closed book!’ \nFilmmaker S: On the internet there are sites of continuity problems from \nmovies. \n \nHe shuffles the photographs again and asks children to create a simple \nnarration for the series of pictures: ‘there was a class’...‘the teacher was \nworking’. \nFilmmaker S: This one has a series of close ups and a reaction shot. \n \nThe children next watch a professional short film along with its \nstoryboard, and they see differences between storyboard and the film \nsequence: \n- They swapped pictures around \n- They didn’t show when the soldier was going to the light. It was more \ninteresting to show the soldier \n- It was a torch not a lantern. \n- There were more details in the film than the storyboard. \n- There was no shot of a plane or the sky at all, only boats. \n- In the storyboard explosion he still has the torch, in the film he drops \nit. \n- How did they do the bomb? (Filmmaker S: they make sound effects, they \njiggle camera about) \n \nIn these sessions, in addition to learning the nuts and bolts of filmmaking, \nchildren gained a growing understanding that storyboards were a kind of ‘draft’ \ntext that could be played-with, changed and improved. They also learned that \nthey could control these elements and change the story. This was a different \nkind of drafting. There was no beginning, middle and end but a series of \ninfinite possibilities.   \n \n \n \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n92 \nDrama and discussion \nTechnical skills and knowledge were not ends in themselves but were to enable \nchildren to tell their stories. Yet children’s ideas proved challenging for their \nteacher and arts partner.  \n \nTo develop themes for the film stories, arts partner NB led children through a \nseries of in-role exercises exploring different emotions (fear, anger, \nconfidence) and these sessions were initially difficult. In this observation, arts \npartner NB tries to create a scenario where children go into role as teachers in \nthe school staff room.  \n \nChildren ask whether they are allowed to swear in these roles and NB \nsays that would not be appropriate in school. The children sit in chairs \naround a circle and pose as they think teachers would sit the staffroom: \nsome pretend to drink tea, others chat. NB pretends to knock on the door \nof the staffroom. She enters the circle space and chaos breaks out. \nChildren press around NB aggressively, shouting at her, shoving and \npointing. She stops the activity and they explain why they reacted so \nviolently:  \n \n-We wanted you to get out \n-You had to go to the headteacher \n-It had nothing to do with us \n-Some of us changed, said ‘sit down, have a cup of tea’ \n-Some of us really wanted to know what you had to say, others said \n‘we’re just teachers, we don’t wan t to know \n-Maybe we were exhausted \n-You needed to go to the teacher of the class \n-I thought you were a child that’s why I tried to push you out, you can’t \nbe in the staffroom \n(NB: Why did you think I was a child?) \n-You knocked on the door, you were quiet \n-You were quite shy \n(NB: Do only adults talk in loud voices?) \n-YES! \n-You were scared \n(NB: Did any of you want to know what I wanted? I’m an adult, a mother. \nI need to talk about something serious. You never got to find out what I \nwanted, what was going on.) \n \nNB decides to ‘hot seat’ herself and children ask her questions in role. \nChildren become intensely focused in the hot seating activity. They elicit \ninformation from NB, who is in role as a mother who is concerned about \nher son’s behaviour in school.  \n \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n93 \nTunde: Have you tried talking to him? \nGrace: To you he’s your son. You think he’s a good boy. Maybe he acts \ndifferent at school. \nMartin: He might be really unhappy in school, in his class.  Did you ask \nhim what’s going on? Has he been going out a lot? \nTunde:  I know it’s none of my business, yeah, but do you think he’s upset \nabout your life in some way, like your working. If there’s a problem with \nthe child does it mean there’s a problem with the parents? \nBobby: There is a chance he is being bulled. \n \nChildren gradually became more experienced at working collaboratively and \nworking in role in drama sessions. Their questions and responses became more \nsensitive. However Teacher KR continued to express dismay at children’s \napparent obsession with violence, as in this observation where children \ndiscussed the emotion ‘Afraid’:   \n \nCharles: As in, afraid to walk down a road because some one was killed \nthere. \nEse: Like when some one dies, you keep thinking about them. \nGrace: (she begins to creates a story) There was a bully, he wants you to \ndo something... \nSunil: When you’re grabbed as a hostage \nDavid: When you’re in a gang, you’re forced into it and you’re forced to \ndo something dangerous. \n \nChildren’s ideas for their own films included a stabbing, a suicide and drug \ndealing on their estate.  Arts partner NB and Teacher KR concluded that none \nof these were ‘film-worthy’, yet they were keen to acknowledge children’s \nconcerns in the filmmaking project.  \n \nThey love to do, they want to do. If they have the structure, they know \nwhat to do. We may think they know how to create structure and \ngenerate creative ideas - but they don’t necessarily know. I can try to \ncreate a place of safety for them. \n(Arts partner NB) \n \nArts partner NB decided to offer children four themes that had repeatedly \ncome up in discussions and drama: Guilty, Powerful, Lonely and Afraid. \nChildren explored these physically, in role, and discussed the underlying \nreasons for these emotional states. \n \nArts partner NB: Powerful, what does that look like? Show me. \nA: Big muscles \nV: Veins showing \nD: Showing off \nG: Tough, like you’d be afraid to go to them. \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n94 \nB: Hench. It means strong. Boys use different words.   \nN: Rising up, going up, stronger \nG: People praise you \nArts partner NB: Is being powerful the same as being physically strong? \nM: You can have mental powers, be mentally powerful. \nG: You can be popular, if you’re weak they won’t like you. \nM: It can mean confidence, courage, doing something new \nK: It would be good to do [a] bullying [film] because some people who do \nbullying they would watch it and it could make them think about what \nthey’re doing.  \nL: Our whole class can be in it. We’ll need a wide shot. \n \nThis is word-level work in a wide learning context, involving enactment \nand discussion. Children know they are making a film, and they already \nhave ideas about what it might look like (We’ll need a wide shot).  \n \nQuality of talk: respect and negotiation        \nIt was observable that children’s talk in class activities had begun to change. \nNB made a point of talking to children as colleagues, with respect.  \n \nWill you agree to give 100% to explore together and get interesting ideas \nfor the film? We only have a few weeks left to go. I appreciate your \nlistening, it’s supportive for us [teachers] and for each other. Think very \nclearly about what you’re going to do. (Arts partner NB to children before \nstarting a drama session) \n \nIn discussions, as the shapes of the final films emerged, there were many more \ninstances of ‘what if?’ and ‘why don’t we?’ type of interactions. Children’s talk \nbecame more tentative. They became more responsive to one another. \n \nT: Sorry for talking long \nM: At least you’re thinking \nI: So you’re trying to tell us... \nO: Can I just say something? \nN: I think, this is a different one [idea]... \nJ: Wouldn’t it be better if we started it this way \nT: This is how I wish it would start \n \nWhen children shared their ideas and their writing with the class, responses \nwere more supportive and sensitive: \n \nT: It didn’t sound like she was reading it, it was like she was acting it. \nD: It was very deep and realistic. \nK: It hurts my feelings and damages my heart. \nG: N and K showed a lot of passion. \nB: They used powerful words to build up a picture \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n95 \nD: N’s was very deep, very realistic \nT: It was like it really actually happened, like happening right now. \nK: It was like a story but a real story. It was short but it explained a lot \n  \nTeacher KR observed that children had become better at negotiating and \nmaking decisions together and that this was having an impact on their attitudes \nto other class work, particularly writing. \n  \n We see them doing more on-task type of talk when they’re working \ntogether, making more decisions. At the beginning it was looking very \nchaotic, the process wasn’t as good. They’re becoming better at listening \nto each other. But it’s very much an ongoing thing. I think they’re better \nat working in partners as well, better at communicating their ideas, and I \nhave noticed more children are building on each other’s ideas in \ndiscussion....Some of the children have said since then [writing after \nrole-play activity] that they like poetry writing. I just don’t think they \nwould have said that before. They hadn’t really done any poetry writing \nof that kind in class. (Teacher KR) \n \nThe language of the arts partner, NB, was a significant influence on children’s \ntalk. She emphasised support ‘for each other’ that included everyone, teachers \nand children together in the project.  She also made clear that there was an \nurgent timeline involved in the project (we only have a few weeks to go), and \nthat work had to be done. \n \nExploratory writing  \nChildren began to write after drama sessions around the themes Guilty, \nPowerful, Lonely and Afraid. Writing from these themes eventually became the \nfour films Best Friend, Shame, Framed and Sweet Teeth. Writing included diary \nentries in role, poems, dialogue, scenes and scripts. These were sometimes but \nusually not re-written; elements can be seen and heard in the final films. The \nfilms could not have been made without these written explorations of language \nand contexts. Teacher KR observed that children were using language from \ndrama in their writing and also that they understood the ultimate purpose of \ntheir writing.   \n \nThey’re learning how to communicate meaning more by working together \nand sharing in drama. They are learning that there can be wider purposes \nfor their writing. For example when they did the poetry it was for the \nfilm, so it was important that it was very good. It was going to be used in \na film and you can’t put something in a film unless it’s very good. It gave \nthem a focus, a reason to do it. They’ve learned about audience. \nCertainly they’ve learned not just the film vocabulary but how to show \nsomething, perspective, showing somebody’s point of view, how you can \ncreate an impact.  \n \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n96 \nAfraid \nDear diary, \nI tried to ask Linda what happened but she ran past me crying. I went \nhome thinking about why she wouldn’t talk to me. I tried to call her. I \nwas worried about her. I can not sleep until I can talk to her. I always \nhear her crying. Why diary why? Maybe she is not my friend. But she has \nbeen my friend ever since Nursery. I can not believe it.  \n \nGuilty \nCan I go back in time? \nNo! \nIf only \nWhat will they say? \nI feel so stupid \nPainful in my belly \nFire burning in my heart \nTell the truth \nTell the truth \nTell the truth \n \nPowerful \nI am vexed \nI can get tormented \nBut if I  \nGet vexed \nNo one must touch me \nBecause I will \nBeat them up into \nCrunchy cornflakes \nMad \nOutraged \nAngry \nBerserk \nDo not touch me \nWhen I am \nThem words!! \n \nChildren continued to develop the four film themes, and began to include their \nknowledge of film and film language as well as their experiences in drama. \nThey wrote scripts, dialogues, scenarios and storyboards. All these texts were \nshared, enacted and discussed. They were working documents that always \nlooked towards the final films.  \n   \n \n \n \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n97 \nFramed  \nCharacters: Lucy, Alice, Mandy and Lila  \nScene 1: In playground Lucy shows off with her bracelet. Alice was very \njealous so she stole it. \n \nLila: Wow! Is that yours? (stares at Lucy’s bracelet) \nLucy: I know it’s mine and I got it in Hong Kong. \nMandy: Hey Alice look at that, it’s very nice (pointing at Lucy’s bracelet) \nAlice: So. I don’t care (Walks off looking angry)    \n \nAngry \nBen’s 8-frame storyboard (although crudely drawn), shows evidence of his \nknowledge of camera techniques. He shows each scene with wide and close-up \nshots, and he includes dialogue in the storyboard (“NO!”; “Revenge!”). On the \nreverse he writes a brief description of his film: \n \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n98 \n  \n \nThis story is about a goalie that is playing a football match but something \ngoes wrong. This something is a boy that is watching. He comes over to the \npitch and distracts the goalie, which makes some one on the other team \nscore. And the goalie is angry and wants revenge so this is what he does. He \ngets a spider and puts it down his back. And the boy says, ‘It’s not OVER!’ \n \nAccording to Teacher KR, Ben was a reluctant writer. In his storyboard he was \nable was able to develop his narrative in two directions, visually and in writing. \nBen was confident and enthusiastic about this task. “It’s easy because I know \nwhat to do, it’s all there” he said as he drew and wrote. He was \nsimultaneously calling on what he learned in the technical, drama and writing \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n99 \nworkshops to develop his story. Ben had found a way into writing where he \ncould also draw, and he could bring his own interests to the story. These types \nof successful approaches to engage underachieving boys in reading and writing \nare noted in other school-based research (Safford, O’Sullivan and Barrs, 2004; \nBarrs and Pidgeon, 1998 and 2002)  \n \nIn developing writing children did not follow a linear plan that began with a \nstory ladder or writing frame which progressed to first and second drafts and \nended with a final copy. The writing trajectory was non-linear, offering \ndifferent stopping places and thinking spaces (poems, diaries, scripts, \ndrawings, storyboards) as children refined ideas for their films.  \n \nThe films \nThe five short films (collectively titled Playtime) are powerful and sometimes \ndisturbing. They are a child’s-eye view of school. Teachers in the films are \nunsympathetic and never seem to notice the bullying, exclusion, stealing and \nother injustices taking place under their noses. They speak to children without \nrespect or understanding – just as the children demonstrated in their earlier \nrole-play: they shout and they want nothing to do with children.  Children are \nleft to sort things out for themselves. All the emotional action takes place in \npeer groups. Everything else – teachers, school, curriculum - is irrelevant.  \n \nThe films contain ideas and dialogue from children’s discussions, role play and \npreparatory writing. We can see and hear the drama, exploratory writing \n(Afraid, Guilty, Powerful, Framed, Angry) and storyboarding in the finished \nfilms. The children’s drama skills are also evident in the performances \nthemselves. Their commitment as actors is total. The films have clearly \nemerged from children’s experiences in filmmaking, film study, drama and \nwriting.  \n \nIn the film Best Friend, a girl shows her classmates her holiday photos. She has \nalso brought a present for her best friend ‘Kim’. In a series of tracking shots, \nshe searches for Kim around the school. But every time she finds her, Kim \nignores her. Kim has ‘a new best friend’ in another group. The girl is \nincreasingly isolated. She is seen in more frequent close-ups and in a flashback \nscene she remembers happier times with her best friend. She finds Kim \npracticing a dance with her ‘new best friends’. She displays the gift she bought \nfor Kim, a beautiful blue glass vase. Kim and her friends are entranced. As they \nreach out to touch it the girl coolly smashes the vase on the ground. In the final \nshot the girl walks away, casting a triumphant glance over her shoulder.  \n \nIn the film Shame a group of boys are playing football. ‘Cameron’ kicks the ball \ntoo high and it smashes a window in the school building. The other boys blame \nhim and they start to fight. A teacher sees Cameron fighting and (apparently \nnot noticing the smashed window) she excludes him from the game. He must \nstand against the wall whilst his other friends continue to play. Enraged and \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n100 \nbored, Cameron taunts the goalie and throws a pebble sharply at the goalie’s \nhead. As the goalie puts his hands to his head the ball hits him hard in the \nstomach and he crumples to the ground in pain. The teacher calls Cameron \nagain and he approaches her. The camera now takes the teacher’s viewpoint, \nand Cameron addresses the camera (and the film audience) directly, protesting \nhis innocence.  \n \nEach film ends with unresolved questions. Visually they convey the isolation of \nchildren in the school. No adult is in close-up, and they are usually off-screen. \nThe children’s relationships are intense. The gaze of the camera shifts \npowerfully from neutral third-party observer to close-ups that convey inner \nthoughts and feelings.   \n \nChanges for children \nIn interviews, children attributed a wide range of learning to the filmmaking \nproject. They said they learned about perseverance and practice. They felt \nthey could speak more confidently and work more effectively in groups. They \nlearned how to use a range of technical equipment and specialist language, and \nthey had used these for a real purpose. They felt they knew how to see, make \nand understand films, and that these experiences had helped them read and \nwrite better. They saw connections between their work in filmmaking and their \nwork in literacy. They were also aware that their improvements in speaking and \nlistening had a direct impact on their peer relationships. As one girl said, ‘We \nused to bully each other, but we know each other much better now.’  \n \nI have learnt to share ideas and be confident. When you want to say \nsomething, but you’re not sure and you know it’s a good idea, I will say it \nnow.(Grace) \n \nIt has helped me feel comfortable, as in comfortable to say something. \n(Ese) \n \nIt takes a long time to make films. I appreciate people that make long \nfilms now. What sort of things they did to make the shots, how to make \nthe sound blend in, how to make it look good. (Billy) \n \nIt was a proper, proper film like a video, like in Hollywood...I’ve never \ndone anything like that, properly. [It] has helped me with understanding. \nI’ve learned new words cos we did quite a lot of reading. I’m better at my \nreading. I’m better at everything actually. (Kree)      \n \nOutcomes: skills for self-expression \nThis partnership was characterised by risk-taking. Teacher K confessed she \noften felt uneasy during the project as end-of-year attainment tests \napproached whilst children explored their chosen themes and stories of bullying \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n101 \nand violence. Children themselves took risks as they exposed themselves in \ndiscussion and role-play.  \n \nTheir work with the emotions was quite big thing. That is not something \nyou necessarily do in Literacy. The way we have worked, some teachers \nmight find it risky, and not just in terms of the content. We really \nworked from week to week. We would change our plans depending on how \nthe session had gone. It was child-centred time. The curriculum is not \nchild centred, it’s very rigid and children can only bring a certain amount \nof themselves to that. It’s not intended to suit them necessarily.  We \nforget that they are still quite young and still have so many ways to \ndevelop. ... A lot is expected of them. They are expected to work \ntogether, talk, think, write. It’s quite intense for them.(Teacher KR) \n \nThe theme of the project did not override technical skills but placed them at \nthe service of what children wanted to communicate. The project connected \nvisual literacy to children’s social and school environment and their private \nexperiences.   \n \nLiteracy in this project began with an enquiry that generated an implicit goal: \nwhat are the stories children want to tell, and how can we help them to tell \nthese stories? The project could have focused solely on the techniques of \nfilmmaking, but the teacher and arts partner underpinned technical learning \nwith a strong affective dimension. Filmmaking was a form of narrative, a \nvehicle for children to say, as arts partner NB hoped, something that means \nsomething to them. The creative project engaged children in voicing, enacting \nand writing about their deepest concerns using visual modes and professional, \nreal-world technical skills.  \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n102 \n \n \n \n \n \n  Class Study Five: Dance Your Literacy Lesson \n \n   Mixed Years 1 & 2 in School B \n   Teachers CM, SP and AR; arts partner GA \n   A 3-term dance project \n \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n103 \n \n \nContext and aims \nSchool B is a successful 1-and-a-half form school in an economically deprived \ninner city area. The majority of pupils are Caribbean Heritage and West \nAfrican. The school has garnered numerous awards for academic success and \nartistic links. Class teachers SP, AR and CM had all been teaching between two \nand five years across Key Stages 1 and 2. SP was an Advanced Skills teacher in \nScience.  \n \nThree mixed Year 1-2 classes and the teachers had a year-long partnership with \na dance company which sent dance specialist GA to teach lessons weekly to \neach class.  \n \nThe teachers had interpreted the brief of the Animating Literacy action \nresearch literally. They decided that the weekly dance sessions would be \nexplicitly linked to Literacy Strategy objectives and that a dance session would \ntake the place of one Literacy Hour every week. The teachers then had to \nensure that the missed Literacy work was made up at other times during the \nweek, leaving little room for the dance teacher to manoeuvre.   \n \nWe plan – she [the arts partner] listens...We have to plan everything, \nMaths, English, Literacy, etc. (Teacher SP)   \n \nIn this situation, the dance project proved disruptive to the teachers’ working \npatterns and exerted considerable pressure on the timetable.   \nThe class teachers were also unhappy with the dance teacher’s behaviour \nmanagement in dance sessions, but months passed before teachers shared their \nconcerns with the arts partner. \n \nProject work: ‘Dance your Literacy lesson’ \nThe teachers wanted dance sessions explicitly linked to weekly National \nLiteracy Strategy objectives and they wanted these links to be made clear to \nchildren. In dance sessions the dance teacher tried to reinforce target \nvocabulary or to support the teaching of forms and structures (such as adverbs, \nverbs or recounts).   \n \nA poster in the school corridor stated: Dance Your Literacy Lesson. In the \nfollowing classroom observation the Literacy Hour lesson was introduced as \nfollows on the whiteboard: \n \n \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n104 \nWHAT IS THE LEARNING INTENTION? \nTO WRITE A RECOUNT OF MY DANCE LESSON.  \nCAPITAL LETTERS. FULL STOPS. \n \nTeacher SP introduced the children’s writing activity: \n \nTeacher SP: We’ve been doing dance lessons for half a year now \nI’d really like to know how you are really feeling about them, how is it \ngoing? When you write, I’m not marking for spelling. I’m not asking for \nlots of difficult words and connectives. It’s like writing in your diaries, \ndon’t worry about the ‘writing’ part. Like your diaries, I want you to be \nhonest, it’s honest, it’s between you and me. I respect your opinions, you \nwon’t get into trouble, I want to know what you think about it. It’s free \nwriting. I’m only marking full stops and capital letters. In your writing \nbooks I want the date, and the learning intention: to write in full \nsentences with capital letters and full stops. Because I don’t have time to \nchat with you about how dance is going. \n \nTeacher SP models a full sentence on white board. I like dance because... \n \nTeacher SP: Why do we make you do it? Why do you dance every Tuesday? \nNot every class does it. Think hard about your answer. \n \nChildren are directed to work in silence on their tables. Children are \ngiven a set of questions to prompt their writing; the high ability table is \nexpected to answer all five questions, the low ability table is expected to \nanswer one question.   \n \nThe teacher’s frustration with the dance sessions is plain (‘Why do we make \nyou do it?) and the links between Literacy and dance do not appear to be \npositive ones (‘I’m not asking for lots of difficult words and connectives’). The \nlearning objective was not to hear children’s thoughts on dance but for them to \nwrite sentences with full stops and capital letters; the teacher makes explicit \nthat that is what she will be marking. Children were also instructed to respond \nin writing to pre-set written questions (eg Why do we do dance in school? What \npart of the dance lesson is your favourite part?). They were not allowed to \nformulate their own questions.  In the absence of any discussion, it was \nperhaps not surprising that all but the most able children had very little to say \nin writing.  \nThe dance teachers were constrained in how they could teach and offer their \nexpertise. They found it difficult to link dance lessons to the teachers’ weekly \nNLS objectives such as story beginnings, middles and endings, recounts, \nadverbs and adjectives.  \n \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n105 \nSometimes what they want, it’s almost impossible to translate it. \nSometimes we really struggled, like with ‘recounts’. It worked, but I’m \nnot sure how much dance there was. (Arts partner GA) \n \nAs a result, children did not develop a particular dance vocabulary or \nknowledge. \n \nArts partner GA: Today I saw some beautiful ideas, people working well \nwith partners, beautiful duets. \nChild: What’s that? \nArts partner GA: Different things I’ve never seen before. Next week we’ll \nbe continuing the story. \n \nCal (Year 2) [Dancer] GA told us some moves to do, but then the rest we \ndone [i.e. improvised]. \n \nAlthough teachers linked dance to weekly Literacy objectives, children did not \nalways seem to make this connection. They particularly enjoyed the social \naspect of dance lessons and being able to work with their friends \n \nJustin: [I like it] because it is something relaxing. \n \nKamali: I like Josiah’s dance. I like his cool moves. \n \nAva: I like Wilf’s dance because he is brave. \n \nEthan: I like dance because it makes you feel strong.  \n \nJaidan: It is fun and it is for everyone. \n \nEllis: I like dance because it gives me ideas for playtime. It is fun. \n \nAva: We do dance in school because our mums and dads might not. \n \nKamali: I like working with Jaidan because he is one of my best friends. It \nkeeps you fit. \n \nMariam: I like the music. I like working with Ethan because he makes me \nlaugh. I like showing my work. \n \nTyrell: it is fun to watch people doing to funny dance. I like watching my \nfriends because friends are good and lovely. \n \n \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n106 \nChildren’s talk and texts \nChildren in pairs and small groups were observed to communicate intensely \nduring dance sessions as they improvised and negotiated moves and patterns. \nSometimes children would not speak but would watch and mirror each other. In \ndance sessions there was a mixture of simple verbal interaction and complex \nnon-verbal interaction, watching and responding: \n \nCh 1: Watch me (moves, swings arms) \nC 2: Watches, copies and adds to movement  \nCh1: No like this. (changes and adds to a new arm movement) \nCh2: Now me. \nCH1: Let’s do it again. First you.     \n \nChildren showed their movements to each other and were invited to say what \nthey liked or disliked. There were no opportunities for extensive talk about \ntheir dance experiences. \n \n       Claire:  I liked the wiggly worm dance \n \nAnna: I like Ava’s dance because she really controls herself.   \n \nDemi: I like Anna’s dance because she is happy in her dance. \n \nIt was evident that when dance was linked to a class text such The Snowman by \nRaymond Briggs children found these sessions memorable. \n       \nI like working with Anna because I know her very well so that I’m \nconfident with her. It is learning because it is always exciting to learn a \nnew thing. I like The Snowman one because I liked it when me and Molly \nwas flying and I was the snowman.(Flora, Year 2) \n \nMy best dance was The Snowman. I think I was good at it, there were lots \nof slow moves I could remember very well....[arts partner] G said \n‘Brilliant, fantastic, good’. I think I’ve improved because I’m learning a \nbit better. (WIlf, Year 2) \n \nTeachers planned to devote two dance sessions to the Benjamin Zephaniah \npoem Body Talk. Dance was developed with music created by the dance \nteacher on a computer and with a taped reading of the poem in Patois by the \nauthor.  The arts partner observed that such changes linking dance to a whole \ntext opened up a wider range of responses from children. \n \nQuite small things made a significant difference. That was very \nrevealing. The Benjamin Zephaniah poem they [the children] found \nliberating. It just hit a chord with them. It was very open and free, \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n107 \ntheir choice of body parts. Children like R, T and J – they were in \nheaven! Some children feel inhibited, are they allowed what they want \nto do? It resonated with them, it released them to contribute \nsomething, and they were very, very happy. (Arts partner GA) \n \nChildren’s dances were individual and unique. Children wrote a poem in the \nstyle of Body Talk. Their drawings are also individual and unique. \n \n \n \n \nTheir writing however does not stray far from the form and language of the \noriginal Benjamin Zephaniah poem:    \n \n In me \nBrain \nThere is a love story \nIn my mouth \nThere are \nJokes \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n108 \nFrom me \nMum \nI got an opera \nIn me \nEars \nThere is de \nRhyme \nIn my belly \nThere is \nA \nComma \n(by Elliot)  \n  \nChildren’s writing during the project showed no evidence of their experiences \nin dance. For example, teachers created a big book to display children’s writing \nfrom the Anthony Browne picture book Piggybook together with photographs of \ndance sessions which were linked to this text. Like the poetry writing, the story \nwriting is all similar in structure and content.  \n \nMy name is Mrs. Piggot and I have a husband and tw sons. My husband is \ndisgusting and my sons are horrible. Every morning I have to make the \nbreakfast. After that I have to hoover the carpets, make the beds and \nwash the dishes. I decided to leave the house and never come back. (by \nJosiah) \n \nMy name is Mrs. Piggot and I have a husband and two sons. I love my \nfamily even though they don’t do any work. I’m so fed up. I feel sad. \n(by Jennifer) \n \nPhotographs of children in dance sessions – unlike their writing – show many \ndifferent responses to their reading. Every child is engaged as they enact the \nbody language of the Zephaniah poem, or the gestures and images of the \nAnthony Brown picture book illustrations.  \n                      \n \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n109 \nDance offered children nonverbal ways to inhabit and respond to the poem and \nthe picture book. Interviews with children revealed they had their own \nknowledge and experiences of dance.  \n \nWilf: At home I make up my own dance. My mum used to be a dancer,  \nballet. I asked my mum, what if you can’t remember something in a \ndance lesson? And she said, you have to make sure everything is very good \nin your mind and work it out in your mind. \n \nJustin: At home I do Michael Jackson dance, and Justin Timberlake. And \nmy sisters dance. I dance in the playground. \n \nSavannah: I do dance at home, ballet dancing. I go to dance lessons, \ndifferent ones [to arts partners’], they do the same shapes as [arts \npartners], they do flower shapes, different songs. I told my mum I want \nto go there, she said yes. \n  \nAfter statutory and optional tests in the Summer term, teachers agreed to \nallow the arts partners to “teach dance for dance’s sake” without linking dance \nto Literacy objectives. This freed-up the project considerably. Teachers also \nagreed to take the three classes to a dance studio to meet professional dancers \nand have a lesson there. Children found this visit memorable. They \nimmediately picked-up on the roles and language of the professional studio. \nThey began to see dance as serious ‘work’. \n \nI would like to work in [dance theatre], where they dance and see famous \npeople. You’ll be on the stage and everybody will see you on the stage. \nThe dance theatre was nice, there was a big gym, and a studio, people \nwho dance. That’s my favourite part, the dance theatre. (Savannah, Year \n1) \n \nWe saw photos of what dancers had done in there. Big split jumps, splits \nin the air, people carrying people. Very amazing and just a bit weird that \nreally good dancers have worked in there and we were working in there \nas well.(WIlf, Year 2)  \n \nIn the Summer term, teachers also began to integrate dance across curriculum \nsubjects such as Geography and Art and Design. Children learned dances from \nother cultures, Banghra and West African. They made paintings and collage of \nAfrican and Indian dancers.  \n \n \n \n \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n110 \nInhibiting factors \nThere was little collaboration between teachers and arts partners in this \nproject. Teachers were adamant that dance must support Literacy objectives \nhowever remote these were from dance, and the arts partners agreed to this \nlimited way of working. The project could have benefited from taking a wider \nview of Literacy, or working extensively around a small set of children’s texts.  \nThe school’s very tight timetable of set subjects and regular target-setting also \nconstrained this creative arts project. Only after Key Stage tests in the Summer \ntem did teachers feel free to teach ‘dance for dances’ sake’. \nFor the most part, the dance specialist was unable to offer her expertise. Over \nthree terms children did not develop specialist dance skills or knowledge. One \nchild in an interview described dance lessons as “like PE but without the balls \nand equipment”. Children who danced in after-school clubs or at home were \nunable to bring these experiences into school.  \nThe arts partner was focused on children’s enjoyment in the lessons (‘They \nwere very, very happy’). But the teachers felt under pressure to cover a pre-\nset amount of material and ensure children’s progress to the next attainment \nlevel. They felt dance put children’s progress at risk.   \n \nOur children were losing one Literacy Hour a week to dance. We have a \nlot of SEN, ADHD children. What the arts partner offered was totally \ndifferent to anything else on offer in our school. (Teacher CM) \n \nThe project was enhanced when children visited professional dance studios and \nwere able to see dance in a real-life context. The teachers realised in \nretrospect that this visit should have been organised at the beginning of the \nproject. By the end of the project the teachers themselves could see the \npositive impact of dance on children and on their own professional practice.  \n \nEmmanuel started listening and responding. He wanted to work with his \nfriends. He was listening, his social skills improved. He felt good about \nworking with professional at school. (Teacher AR) \n \nJustin struggles with class Literacy. He is aware of his ‘low ability’ \nposition in bottom literacy group, that he always had adult help. Dance \nbrought out a different Justin. Through physical learning he became \ntalented, the leader. It was a way to empower him. (Teacher SP) \n \nThe project was an amazing, exciting, sometimes difficult journey…We \nare looking at it differently now. Before, we said: this is our learning \nobjective, this is what we want, this is the text, now you [arts partner] \ngo plan it. We hadn’t used their expertise and knowledge… We are \nlooking more now at children’s verbal skills. We enjoy asking them about \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n111 \ntheir dance, how are you moving, what are you feeling?…We’ve learned \nfrom dancers, bringing out their knowledge that we didn’t know existed. \nOur confidence changed, we were more relaxed. Children’s enjoyment is \nevident, our enjoyment is evident.  (Teacher CM) \n \nTeacher CM acknowledged the link between the teacher’s enjoyment and \nrelaxation in a creative arts project and what children gain from the \nexperience. Teachers in this project also realised that they could not cling to \ntheir pre-set learning objectives. They had to let in the arts partner’s \nexpertise, and they had to acknowledge what children were actually learning in \nthese experiences.   \n \n   \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n112 \n \nCommon factors in children’s language and literacy development \nin creative arts projects \nIn effective creative arts projects, children returned to themes and expressed \nthem in a variety of modes over time.  They had many opportunities for \nsymbolising meaning, including writing.   \n \nWe observed that projects which aimed explicitly to ‘inspire children to write’ \ngenerated little, or superficial writing, whereas partnerships that promoted \ndiscussion and reflection around big themes (our stories, identity, audience, \nheritage) produced a wider range of authentic, committed writing.  \n \nIn the writing-focussed classrooms there was little discussion. Emphasis fell on \nthe production of texts as a response to an artistic stimulus. In the classrooms \nthat were more broadly focussed, teachers and arts partners encouraged \nchildren to work extensively in the area of the art form (film study, drama, \nartwork, storytelling, theatre) and  talk was promoted in a wide range of \ncontexts: in role play, in exploratory thinking, in group work, in collaborative \nwriting, in reflective discussion. Children’s talk became more explicit and \naware in the context of creative projects as they explored big themes using \nnew vocabulary, skills and understanding.  \n \nIn effective projects, teachers used the energy of the arts activities to move \nchildren from talk towards writing, and this writing development was non-\nlinear. Children deepened their understanding of a creative arts practice by \nreturning to its themes in talk and in writing. As part of the writing trajectory, \nideas were explored in drawings, storyboards, models, enactments, notes, \ndialogues and other forms of multi-modal drafting. There were frequent \nopportunities for what has been described as “the interaction of hand and \nmind”. This is the conceptualisation by the Assessment of Performance Unit in \nDesign and Technology (APU 1991) of the process by which ‘hazy ideas’ in the \nhead become concrete in reality (see Chapter 9). This model was designed to \nshow development in a specific subject (D&T), but it can also illustrate literacy \ndevelopment: how oral language becomes writing. Using the APU’s model, the \nteaching pattern in Teacher G’s class where children worked with arts partner \nS can be visualised:   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n113 \nDrama, artwork & talk    Reading & writing \n \nlearning how to work in drama   reading the novel \nlearning terms, how to use space    \n \nDiscussing the novel \n \npicture of the character    words to describe her  \n \ndrawings of her life & family         a magazine feature about her \n \nwatching & discussing film \nabout Bangladesh village \n              \nfreeze frames: village life internet search for images and \nflags, hearing and singing anthems \n \nessay on understandings of the \nanthem \n \nvisualisation of landscape    poetic text around picture \npainting of landscape \n \nfreeze frames: the playground    \nresponses & discussion \n \nfamily trees words for mum, dad,  etc in \ndifferent languages \n \nphotograph album \ndescribing memories orally describing memories in writing \n  \ndialogues in role     letters in role; poems in role \n \nrole play as school staff,     \nhow can we help? \n \nwalking around and seeing estate  \nthrough new arrival’s eyes    school policies: new arrivals,  \n                bullying; bilingual support  \n                materials, translations \n \n \n \n \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n114 \nThis pattern of learning begins with explicit naming and teaching of language \nand skills in the creative arts area. This learning is followed by explorations \nwhere children given responsibility to use their new techniques and vocabulary \nto create something original. They have opportunities to play, experiment and \npractise with materials, techniques and skills.  \n \nAdditional factors \nThere were additional common factors in creative arts projects that \nunderpinned children’s language and literacy development. Teachers \nextensively developed the themes and learning initiated with arts partners. \nTeachers orchestrated children’s discussion, reflection and writing in between \nthe weekly (or less frequent) arts partner visits. Teacher commitment and \npractice was crucial in embedding creative work. \n \nIn effective projects there was three-way creativity. Teacher, arts partner and \nchildren brought knowledge and experiences to the project, and each was able \nto make decisions that influenced its development. Children were allowed to \nhave choice and voice. Their interests and enthusiasms had a secure place in \nthe project, even where these were challenging.    \n  \nTeachers were co-learners who maximised the expertise of arts partners. They \nshared their knowledge of the class and individuals. Teachers and arts partners \nmade their collaboration explicit to children in actions and language. They \nmodelled effective working relationships. Children could see them ‘thinking \naloud’. They set high expectations and professional standards of working.  \n \nIn some effective projects there were often marked improvements in what \nDorothy Heathcote (1985) calls ‘the social health of the class’. The experiences \nand learning in creative arts projects had an effect on the class as a social unit, \nenabling them at best to become a more positive community, more inclusive \nand respectful of each other, more effective at working together and \ncollaborating, better at talking together.  \n   \n \n \n \n \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n115 \n \n \n \n \nPart 2 \n \nChildren’s language and literacy in creative arts work \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n116 \n \n    \n \n    Chapter 5  \n     \n \n    Talk  \n \n \n \nThere is value in the natural talk that the arts allow. I wonder how it \ncan be woven into a more structured approach to language and literacy. \nCreative work, it seems to me, is valuable in language development and \ntherefore intrinsic in literacy. (Teacher AO)  \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n117 \n \nChildren’s talk in creative arts work \nObservations in classrooms revealed a stunning variety of talk amongst children \nand between children and adults in the context of creative arts projects. \nWhatever the art form children were learning - how to make a sculpture, how \nto create a drama or a dance, how to plan a film - it was a process that was \nusually memorable, active, social and fun. Children often worked with their \nfriends rather than in ability groups, and through their talk they learned from \neach other. \n \nWe observed children using a wide range of talk for learning. They acquired \nspecialist language and concepts which they applied to their talk and their \nthinking as well as to their doing and making. Where teachers explicitly \ndeveloped speaking and listening in creative arts projects they observed \nchildren’s \n \n¾ Increased confidence in speaking, and clearer speaking \n¾ Improved listening and concentration \n¾ More open questions \n¾ More reflective talk \n¾ Improved interpersonal relationships in the class \n \nChildren’s learning in creative arts projects was evident in their talk. \nChildren’s engagement was also evident because they were often able to bring \ntheir personal experiences to the activities in the project. Teachers themselves \nreported that they had ‘real’ conversations with children in creative arts \nprojects.  \n \nIn the following observation, Year 1 children are drawing rainforest creatures \nto be made into 3-D sculptures for giant trees. Sarah, Mia and Michaela show \nattention to detail. They are completely engaged in their activity. They show \ncuriosity and humour. As they work and talk, they comment on the \ntransformation of their drawings. \n \n Sarah: I draw the tree like THAT. (draws) \n \nMichaela: Oh that’s a nice tree. You drawed a tree beside it. \n \nSarah: Mine [frog] is jumping up. \n \nMia:  I can’t draw a tree. I have to draw a branch. These are the leaves. \nWe did one smaller to this yesterday. \n \nSarah: You can’t really see it [legs] because of the branches. It’s hairy \n[bird], in fact it has fur all around it. \n \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n118 \nBob: How many legs does a leopard have? \n \nSarah: Four. [continues drawing] Then a little bit of white. \n \nMichaela: Are we gonna colour these in? That looks a bit silly, I put the \nlegs wrong. When you colour it in you won’t see that bit. \n \nMia: I’ve got a kitten cat at home. \n \nSarah: I could change this [bird] into a lizard. \n \nMia: I’ve done this in Miss A’s class, it’s lovely. \n \nSarah: Mine is a happy one. How do you draw leopard feet?  \n \nMia: Like a cat \n \nSarah:  Oh, claws! \n \nMichaela: I was about to do another leg, a fifth leg! [Laughs] \n \nSarah: I done a jaguar, a lizard like that, and a chameleon. This is about \ndetail. Not just about drawing. If you draw something, it has to be in \ndetail. There’s the iguana. There’s the fly comin’ into its mouth, it is IN \nhis mouth! How many flies do they eat? \n \nMia: If you come to my house this summer I won’t be there. I’ll be in \nSerbia. My family is in Serbia and I speak Serbian. \n \nSarah: He’s got four flies, see, look! How many flies he’s gonna get? FIVE. \n \nBob: This one’s a silly one cos he’s got 8 eyes and a mouth up here. It’s \nan ant. \n \nThis companionable working talk mainly consists of parallel commentaries – \nindividual children talking to themselves about the progress of their own \ndrawings – but there are also occasional exchanges. Children seem aware of \neach other’s drawing, while being focused on their own.  \n \nThe talk is supportive of the drawing: children give running commentaries on \nhow they are going about their pictures, and the talk seems to help the work: \n \n‘I draw the tree like THAT’ \n‘These are the leaves. We did one smaller than this yesterday.’ \n \n \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n119 \nThey offer frequent evaluative comments on each other’s work and on their \nown work: \n \n‘Oh that’s a nice tree.’ \n‘That looks a bit silly, I put the legs wrong.’ \n \nSome talk involves rapid exchanges of information: \n \n‘How do you draw leopard feet?’ \n‘Like a cat’ \n‘Oh, claws!’ \n \nThe children are concentrated on the technical demands of this task and reveal \ntheir awareness of techniques they can use: \n \n‘When you colour it you won’t see that bit’ \n‘I could change this into a lizard.’ \n \nAt one point, Sarah gives herself an emphatic reminder of the main principle \nthat she needs to remember: \n \n‘This is about detail. Not just about drawing. If you draw something it has \nto be in detail.’ \n \nShe is echoing something that has been said by the arts partner; Sarah has \nreally internalised this piece of teaching and taken it to heart. As she watches \nthe development on paper of her rainforest creatures, she is also thinking \nabout what she has to do to realise that imaginary world.  \n \nThe children’s talk is unusually focused, and there is little that is extraneous to \nthe task. Towards the end of the transcript, however, a more playful and \nconfident tone enters the dialogue. Sarah acts out what is going on in her \npicture: \n \n‘There’s the iguana. There’s the fly comin into its mouth, it is IN his \nmouth!’ \n \nIn this more relaxed mood, Mia suddenly makes quite a long personal \nstatement: \n \n‘If you come to my house this summer I won’t be there. I’ll be in Serbia. \nMy family is in Serbia and I speak Serbian.’ \n \nPerhaps Mia feels able to trust her peers with this confidence in the warm and \nsupportive atmosphere generated by this activity. Nobody actually replies to \nher, but she has shared something of importance with the group.  \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n120 \n \nThe talk in this group has a learning function; their talk is supportive of their \nwork and serves as a way of controlling their activity, as when Michaela plans \nto change her drawing and Sarah reminds herself of the need to draw detail. It \nhighlights the amount of self-evaluation that goes on as children undertake this \nkind of task. It also shows children playing within the task in a way which helps \nthem to imagine what they are drawing more fully. It reveals a growing \nconfidence in children as they move further into the task. \n \nPeer and adult interaction \nChildren in other classrooms were observed to have lengthy conversations with \neach other and with teachers as they worked in creative arts projects. \n \n[Year 6 children and teacher are painting together] \nBoy: Was there paint in the olden days? \nTeacher AO: Yes, but it was always made from natural materials.        \nGirl: My mum has a farm in Portugal, she has one pig and the floor is all \ndirty. \nBoy: My Nan when she told me to look after the pigs I got scared. \nBoy: When I went to Portugal, we had a pig, I was holding the legs, the \nrope broke, I had to throw the knife at him! \nTeacher AO: What! You held a pig? Why were you doing that? \nBoy: To kill him.  \nTeacher: Oh I don’t know if I could do that. \nGirl: My Nan has a donkey on her farm, behind her house she grows \ngrapes. Everyone knows my Nan and me! One morning I got up early and \npicked grapes and corn. \nTeacher: I love grapes. \nBoy: My Nan has horse. Do you know why? \nTeacher AO: No, why? \nBoy: To put with the cart [mimes horse and cart]! \nTeacher AO: And do you think you prefer the city like London or the \ncountry like Portugal? \nBoy: I like the country. \n \nIt was notable that in this climate teachers were not talking at children but \ntalking with them. In creative project work teachers could ask children \nquestions and children could ask teachers questions that had no other place in \nthe curriculum. Two teachers (AO and KR) said that in creative projects “It was \nthe first time I had a real conversation with them [children]”. Teacher-child \nrelationships were noticeably improved in these encounters and also helped \nteachers assess children’s understanding of the work itself.     \n \n \n \n \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n121 \nTalk is so directed in the classroom. It’s only when you talk with them \nthat you find out where they are. Otherwise you never know where \nthey are. It’s by listening to them that you find out how they learn, \nwhat they need to know. (Year 5 Teacher JA) \n \nChildren were also observed to use their first languages extensively in creative \narts projects, spontaneously translating and ‘code-switching’ – an indication \nthat they were feeling very secure and relaxed - but not always with approval \nfrom peers: \n \n[Portuguese talk] \nBoy 1, Year 6 to Artist ML: How do you say ‘Colina’ in English? \nArts partner ML: Colina – hill. [Gestures] Montana [high], colina \n[low]. \n[Portuguese talk]  \nGirl, Year 6: Stop talking Portuguese, this is not a Portuguese \n school! \nArts partner ML: But they need to understand, if it’s not clear \nGirl: They say horrible things about us. \n \nThe Portuguese-speaking artist who intervenes here on behalf of the \nPortuguese-speaking Year 6 children later noted that many of them speak \n‘country’ or non-standard dialects of Portuguese. Non-standard dialects are an \naspect of children’s language for which there is virtually no official curriculum \nspace. But in this creative arts project the bilingual arts partner created a \npurposeful context where children were able to use their first language for \nlearning.  \n \nAction and contemplation \nChildren’s talk often expressed awareness of two different worlds: the external \nworld of techniques and materials, and the internal world of the imagination. \nThese worlds came together in the making of artwork.  \n \nWilliam in Year 5 showed an observer his models of characters in a scene from \na fairy tale.   \n \nIt’s time for dipping [in glue] so it’ll be perfect. Tomorrow when you take \nit out, leave it for one-minute, you can see [shapes and colours] coming \nthrough. [He dips his models in glue and leaves them to dry]. This is when \nthe prince is dreaming about the princess. \n \nLike Sarah and her drawings of rainforest creatures, William is thinking and \ntalking about two things: the imaginary world of the fairy tale and the \ntechniques to realise that world in reality. He is describing what he has done to \nmake his models, he is observing changes, and he is simultaneously imagining a \nscene in a fairy tale. He is active and reflective.  \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n122 \n \nChildren were also observed to talk to themselves as they worked:  \n \nGirl, Year 6 [to herself]:  After I paint it, I’m gonna put the sun on. I don’t \nwant to put the sun on and then paint it... you don’t want to put too much. \nIt’s sticky on my hands....I need a brush, oh here it is. Let me get some \nbrown, dark brown. Mine doesn’t need too much [paint]. I need yellow for \nthe sun, there are little black dots I need to colour in yellow. \n \nThis girl ‘sees’ her painting in her head. She knows and verbalises what she \nneeds to do to realise this image (a brush…brown, dark brown...yellow). She \nknows the sequence in which she must work (After I paint it I’m gonna put the \nsun on).   \n  \nChildren were also observed to use what they had made for role play and \nimaginative play: \n \nGirl, Year 5: [to herself, playing with her models of story characters]: You \nare so lazy people! Sitting down, you can’t be bothered to stand up! \n \nGirl 1, Year 5 [with models of pumpkins]: Can I buy some of your pumpkins? \nGirl 2: No! \nGirl 1: Please let me buy some of your pumpkins! They are so lovely and \n orange! \nGirl 2: No! \n[Portuguese talk] \n \nChildren became more confident about their work as they talked, particularly \nwhere they felt anxious about their skills. \n \nGirl, Year 5:  No Shanice, first you curl it around, put in some tissue, roll \naround, around, around and… \nShanice: I understand what you’re doing. \nGirl: You have to put them FAT, have a little faith! \nShanice: See, put plastecine here. \nGirl: Put some blutack on the tree so it can stand. \n \nWilf, Year 2: Working together is good, we can share our ideas and work it \nout. Let’s use both of them [ideas], one in one part, one in another. \n \nChildren asked ‘How’ questions (How do I do this?). They expressed needs, \nrequests and demands (I need more tape; Can you help me? You do it!). They \nwould praise or criticise each other’s work. They sometimes expressed \nfrustration (I can’t do this). They considered materials and possibilities (I could \nuse straw or pipe cleaners to make the roof, which would look better?). They \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n123 \nverbalised instructions and often revealed linguistic misunderstandings (Is a \nnightingale a girl that comes out at night?) \n \nThe many and varied types of talk in creative work can be seen to mirror the \nkinds of talk that children may have outside school, at home, where they may \nengage in activities alongside an adult - cooking, cleaning, walking, driving, \ntaking the bus, shopping, playing computer games or fixing things (cf Gordon \nWells 1986).  \n \nWork in the creative arts may be able to bridge the gap between the range of \nchildren’s talk outside of school and the narrow parameters of children’s talk \nwe observed in many other classroom contexts. Work in creative projects has \nthe potential to bring the diversity of children’s talk and language into the \nclassroom. Children’s talk in creative projects activities often revealed their \nthinking as they worked, as they talked extensively about the process, making \ndecisions, estimating and measuring, choosing, negotiating, comparing and \nevaluating.   \n  \nChildren’s talk in ‘literacy’  \nThe wide-ranging conversations in creative arts projects were in sharp contrast \nto talk in other classroom contexts. It was observable that children’s talk in \ncreative arts projects was more sophisticated and lengthy than in other \nteacher-led classroom talk where children normally responded in short, often \none word answers to teacher questions.  \n \nAlthough teachers have flexibility with regard to the Literacy Strategy (now the \nPrimary Strategy), work in creative arts projects did not seem to be associated \nwith change in this area. A very narrow range of talk was observed in literacy \ncontexts. Questions were closed. Children had few opportunities for discussion. \nThey were often expected to work in silence at ability tables.  There was a \nstrong emphasis on the features of writing genres, word level structures such as \nconnectives, and transcription. This was true even in cross-curricular work. \n  \nThe following observation follows a teacher (M) and a Year 4 class for one hour \nin the school’s ICT suite. The children were learning how to write newspaper \nstories, which is a Literacy Strategy objective. They were also learning about \nAncient Egypt which was their History topic. This was a cross-curricular project \nusing ICT. Children worked in pairs on word-processing their newspaper stories. \nScrutiny of the transcript shows that the multiple demands made on both \nchildren and teacher by this cross-curricular topic tended to narrow, rather \nthan broaden, the nature of the learning experience. \n \n \n \n \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n124 \nLearning Objective: To write a newspaper story  \n \nTeacher M and the Year 4 class are in the computer suite. The class is \nlearning how to write a newspaper article through their history topic, \nancient Egypt.  \n \n(0910)  \nThey begin by listening to a CD rom of the voice of the explorer Howard \nCarter. He is describing his discovery of Tutankhamon’s tomb. The audio \nrecording is difficult to understand because it is an old recording and \nCarter speaks with a very strong ‘RP’ accent. The children listen.   \n \nM: Brilliant. That was Howard Carter himself, how it felt entering the \ntombs and what he saw. What did he see? \n \nChildren: ?? (uncomprehending) \n \nBoy: Linen? \n \nM: The linen bandages surrounding the body. What did he say when he \nopened the coffin? \n \nChildren: ?? (uncomprehending) \n \nM: How many coffins were there? \n \nBoy: Three. \n \nM: Well done, good listening. What was amazing about it? \n \nBoy: They were still together. \n \nM: He saw the....(waits for answer)? \n \nBoy: Mask. \n \nM: The workmanship of the gold mask. What else did they see? \n \nBoy: Shrines? \n \nM: No. He said there were still wood chippings from their work all those \nthousands of years ago. What did they bury with the pharaohs? \n \nGirl: Belongings. \n \nM: What kind of belongings? \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n125 \n \nGirl: Clothes  \nGirl: Food. \n \nM: And other things from their life, why did they want them to be \ncomfortable? \n \nBoy: They believed in the afterlife. \n \nBoy: When the first one dies, the others are put with him. \n \nM: The family is buried together in the same tomb. Who feels they’ve \nlearned a lot this week [from our topic work]? \n \n(Children raise hands) \n \nM: I can see it coming through in your paragraphs and in your posters. \n \nThe teacher gives a technical explanation of how children should find \ntheir saved work in the computers. She tells children they will continue \nworking on the newspaper articles they began writing in pairs earlier in \nthe week. The articles are stories made-up by the children, but using \nnewspaper conventions.  \n \nM: First we had to write the five Ws: who, what, when, were, why. What \nwas the point? Why do I need to know these for a newspaper article? \n \nChildren: ?? \n \nBoy: They go at the end? \n \nM: No. In the first sentence you tell me the five Ws. The next paragraph? \n \nBoy: Detail. \n \nM: How will we write the rest? \n \nB: In order. \n \nM: What kind of order? \n \nGirl: Chronological order. \n \nM (reviews what children need to write in their first sentence, in the first \nparagraph: the 5 Ws) Anything else? \n \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n126 \nGirl: Bullet points. \n \nM: No, that was instructions, when we did instructions. \n \nGirl: Past tense. \n \nM: We write it in the past tense. \n \nBoy: Conclusion? \n \nBoy: Third person. \n \nM: We write it in the third person. We use direct and indirect speech. Can \nanyone give me examples of direct and indirect speech? \n \nGirl: Direct speech is: I saw the car crash walking to school. \n \nGirl: Indirect speech is when you say it to someone else. \n \nM: You need a snappy, eye-catching headline. I don’t want you to worry \nabout Spellcheck, get all your ideas down first. \n \n(0930)  \nThe children begin to work in pairs. Teacher M looks at Aisha’s and \nLeonie’s writing so far.  \n \nM: This isn’t a story, this is a newspaper article. What are the facts? [she \ntypes for them: ‘Pharaoh’s wife falls pregnant’] Keep going. \n \nThe children are working hard to write one sentence with 5 Ws in it. \n \nAfter the teacher’s headline ‘ Pharaoh’s Wife Falls Pregnant’ Leonie and \nAisha write: \n \nLast night pharaoh’s wife found out she was pregnant with his baby. \nThe pharaoh was so happy, he didn’t know if it was a boy or a girl. \n \nLeonie: When my mum was pregnant she knew it was a girl and that it \nwas my sister! \n \nAisha continues the story orally: When the baby’s head was coming out, \npharaoh saw it was a boy and said, ‘We will name him Tutankamon’! \n \n[Aisha and Leonie have a seemingly irrepressible urge to tell this as a \nstory as they revert to narrative.] \n \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n127 \nAisha: [asking herself the rhetorical question] Where? In a birthing pool. \n[she continues orally as if she is telling a story] But when he went to birth \nschool [sic], he found out it was a boy.  \n \nLeonie: Now we need to do Spell Check. [they correct spellings on the two \nsentences they have written] \n \nAisha: [continuing the narrative orally] When he saw the baby he said, \nit’s a beautiful boy! \n \nLeonie and Aisha do not get any further. \n  \n(0950) \n Teacher M stops the class to review the work in a plenary. \n \nM: Tell me again what we need in the first paragraph? \n \nChildren: The five Ws. \n \nM: We do it in ONE sentence, not in two or five. Am I allowed to give my \nopinions? \n \nChildren: No. \n \nM: What am I allowed to give in a newspaper article? \n \nChildren: Facts. \n \nM: You need to give evidence to support the facts. Facts only in a \nnewspaper article. Who thinks they have written a really good paragraph \nwith 5 Ws? [She asks two other girls to read out their first sentence, \nlistens and responds] I heard only 2 Ws. Who? \n \nChildren: Pharaoh \n \nM: And What? \n \nChildren: Building a sphinx. \n \nThe cross-curricular nature of the lesson was presumably intended to make this \nactivity more immediately interesting and accessible to children. Here was a \nreal voice from history, on tape, describing an amazing experience. But \nchildren seemed not entirely to appreciate the significance of what they were \nhearing. It might have helped them to have had a transcript of the audio \nrecording, which was difficult to take in on one hearing.  \n \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n128 \nIn the event, not much time was spent in discussing this account of a historic \nexperience. Instead, the teacher concentrated on finding out what children had \nheard and remembered, often asking questions which did not require more \nthan a one-word answer: \n \n‘How many coffins were there?’ \n‘Three.’ \n \nThe teacher is moving through this part of the lesson, which relates to the \nHistory topic, in order to arrive at the newspaper article writing, which is the \nmain Literacy learning objective for the session. This necessitates a further \nquestion-and-answer session, recapping on what children have been taught \nabout writing a newspaper story. Again, the teacher-pupil dialogue becomes \nmainly a series of teacher’s questions with short factual answers: \n \n‘How will we write the rest?’ \n‘In order.’ \n‘What kind of order?’ \n‘Chronological order.’ \n \nSometimes children know the answers, sometimes they just guess: \n \n‘Anything else?’ \n‘Bullet points.’ \n‘No that was instructions, when we did instructions.’ \n \nThe need to teach the features of the chosen genre dominate this dialogue, \nand the lesson. Many children struggled in this activity, and especially with the \nrequirement to write the ‘5 Ws’ (who, what, when, where, why) in a single \nopening sentence. \n \n The teacher here is conscientiously trying to cover all the bases, and to teach \neverything she believes that it is important for children to know in order to \ngain control of this genre. (She is also following the Literacy Hour timetable: \n20-minutes of whole class teaching, 20-minutes of independent work and a 10-\nminute plenary.) But the tight focus on this learning objective seems to \noverwhelm other possible learning that might have resulted from the \nexperience of hearing the discoverer of Tutenkhamon’s tomb speak in person.  \n \nAn added difficulty for children was that they were being instructed to write an \nimaginary story about ancient Egypt (using their own ideas and what they knew \nfrom their History topic) in the form of a newspaper article, which the teacher \nstressed should be factual: \n \n‘This isn’t a story, this is a newspaper article. What are the facts?’ \n \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n129 \nLeonie and Aisha’s attempts to follow these instructions showed that they were \nmuch more at home with a narrative mode than with the report genre that the \nteacher wanted them to adopt. They continually moved into story-telling: \n \n‘When the baby’s head was coming out, Pharaoh saw it was a boy and \nsaid, ‘We will name him Tutenkhamon.’’   \n \nDespite the modern resources of this lesson, therefore, with its use of media \nand ICT, the teacher-pupil dialogue is an example of teacher-dominated \nquestion and answer, with pupils’ answers getting shorter rather than longer. \nThis example, however, was not uncharacteristic of the kind of talk which went \non in Literacy plenary sessions. It is difficult to generate and sustain high \nquality talk with children in a whole class group, but it is nearly impossible to \ndo so while trying to transmission-teach the features of a genre in this way. As \nRobin Alexander (2004), drawing on the evidence of several research studies, \nobserves: \n  \n‘…while teaching methods, patterns of classroom organisation and the \nhandling of time, space and resources have changed considerably in \nliteracy and numeracy lessons, practice below the structural surface has \nchanged rather less. Pupil-teacher interaction is still dominated by closed \nquestions, brief answers which teachers do not build on, phatic praise \nrather than diagnostic feedback, and an emphasis on recalling \ninformation rather than on speculating and problem solving.’ \nThe role of reflective talk \nThe contrast between the confident talk and extended utterances observed \nwhen children were working on creative arts projects, and the more hesitant \none-word answers that were often their only contributions to whole class \nLiteracy sessions was striking. Work in the arts creates contexts where children \ntalk with each other and with adults. Their talk is practical, about doing and \nmaking. It is also companionable, social and personal. Children’s talk is \nspeculative and exploratory. It is also imaginary and empathetic, in role play \nwith peers and in solitary, internal monologues. Through their talk children \nmediated external, practical worlds and internal, imaginary worlds.  \nAs we also showed in Chapter Four, looking at common factors in children’s \nlanguage and literacy development, how teachers used the energy of the \ncreative arts activities to move children from talk towards writing.  We will \nnow look at some of these texts in more detail. \n \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n130 \n \n \n \n                   Chapter 6 \n \n \n  Writing and multimodal texts \n \n \n   I love Jamdher, my beautiful village \n   Climbing trees in that hot place \n   Playing football \n   In the burning space \n   The eating my mum’s yummy rice \n   It makes me red with the spice! \n   (Rahela, Year 5) \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n131 \n \nMoving towards writing \nTalk and work in creative arts projects helped children generate ideas for their \nown writing. Teachers observed children write enthusiastically and \nspontaneously after activities or workshops such as storytelling, drama, music \nor artwork. They did not stare at the blank page because they had had an \nactive, often physical, experience and context for their writing.  \n \nFor teachers like MK (Class Study Three) the creative arts project provided a \nstimulus for children’s writing. For teachers like GD (Class Study One) and KR \n(Class Study Four) creative arts projects provided themes for a range of \nchildren’s writing. Where teachers explicitly linked talk and work in creative \nprojects to texts, drama, speaking and listening and then to writing, they \nobserved children’s \n \n¾ Increased confidence and willingness to have a go at writing \n¾ Increased control of narrative \n¾ Enthusiasm for writing \n¾ Improvements in quantity and quality of writing \n \nIn these situations children had many opportunities to return to their ideas and \ntry them out in different multimodal forms such as storyboards, scripts or \ndrawings with words. Writing did not follow a linear path that began with an \noutline or story-ladder, progressed through first and second drafts and ended \nwith a final copy in a Literacy Book. In Teacher KR’s class, children’s writing \nwas in the context of a final, visual product (films). In Teacher GD’s class, \nwriting was a mode to explore and enact different scenes, situations and \nvoices.  \n \nIn this section we present a range of children’s writing and multimedia texts \nthat arose from work in creative arts projects: a poem, a painting with writing, \na multimedia story, a film storyboard and a collaborative film. These texts are \nfrom the Class Studies in drama, multimedia and filmmaking.  \n \nIn each sample, we examined children’s writing and multimodal texts using an \nanalysis framework that reflected the diverse nature of projects in classrooms \n(Appendix 6). The framework first considers the context of the writing, how it \nwas part of the creative arts project. It notes the history of the writing, how it \nemerged and was developed in the context of the project. It looks at what \nmakes a text multi-modal: is it artwork, computer images, graphics, moving \nimages or is it references in the writing itself to other modes such as film?  It \nnotes where the writing shows evidence of skills that can be traced to \nchildren’s learning in the creative arts project. The framework also notes how \nwork in the project has influenced the writer’s stance, sense of audience and \nimaginative engagement in the writing. We evaluate the overall effectiveness \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n132 \nof texts, and to what extent other influences - such as computer games or \ntelevision - are also apparent.    \n \nI am Aysha \nA poem and a painting with text  \nRahela, Year 5, School H \n(Class Study One) \n \nRahela is a bilingual child who was born in London. She uses Bengali and English \nfluently. Her family’s roots are in Shilwa, Bangladesh and they visit Bangladesh \nevery summer. Raehla’s mother is a child minder, her father works as a waiter \nin a restaurant. Her family prefers to wear traditional Bangladeshi clothing.  \nHer mother and two older sisters are confident in their use of spoken English. \nRahela’s family have a close relationship with the school and attend most \nfunctions and meetings. Rahela’s ambition in Year 5 is to be a doctor or lawyer \n\"because they earn plenty of money\". \n \nRahela’s poem and her text-painting were two of many writing activities \ndeveloped through dramatic explorations of the world of the class novel, Lost \nfor Words. Children had found out about the protagonist Aysha, her family, the \nevents of her early childhood and what kind of girl she was. Children learned \nBengali words for members of Aysha’s family (Rahela already knew these \nwords) and the names of her relatives. At this point in their reading of the \nnovel, Aysha has learned that she is moving to England. \n \n \nI am Aysha \nA woman, the prophet Muhammad’s favourite wife \nHussain’s helpful cousin \nComla’s steadfast cousin \n \nAma’s and Uba’s loving daughter \nDada’s and Dadi’s faithful granddaughter \n \nActive and sporty \nLike an olympic star \nI run like a whizzing car \n \nI am agile, strong \nFast as a leopard \nBrave and powerful \nLike a Bengal tiger \n \n \n \n \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n133 \nBut \nI am kind, thoughtful \nOr as shy as a timid deer \n \nAnd never give up! \n \nI love Jamdher, my beautiful village \nClimbing trees in that hot place \nPlaying football \nIn the burning space \nThe eating my mum’s yummy rice \nIt makes me red with the spice! \n \nI feel upset leaving my family \nDepressed at saying goodbye \nWhy did Uba not take me \nWhen I was little? \n \nWhy now? \nI would like to meet new friends in my new school \nTo have Bengali friends to teach me the English rules \nAnd talk to me in Bengali so I can feel religious \nAnd stop the others looking suspicious. \n \n \nRahela’s work in drama is evident in her writing. She has internalised the \nhistory, voice and stance of Aysha, a fictional character in the novel. She \nwrites as ‘I’. She is addressing the audience personally and forcefully: this is \nwho I am.   \n \nRahela has also internalised the expressive skills of drama which have allowed \nher to give full voice to the fictional character in writing. The poem is \neffective; we find out quite a lot about Aysha, her past, present and future, \nfrom this short piece of writing.  The poem begins on an assertive, lively and \noptimistic note. There is a strong shift in mood as Aysha expresses her fears \nabout leaving her village.   \n  \nIn drama work Rahela learned how to explore the pauses and thinking spaces in \nthe story where narrative action momentarily stops. There is no doing in her \npoem. It is all thought. Aysha is on the brink of a new life, but not there yet.  \n \nHer poem tries to answer a fundamental question, Who am I?  It is an internal \nmonologue even as it addresses the reader. In her writing Rahela has also used \nher own knowledge, language and experiences as a Muslim girl in England. She \nalludes to the ‘English rules’ and other people ‘looking suspicious’. These \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n134 \nexperiences have not yet appeared in the novel but Rahela knows they are \nthere, waiting for the fictional Aysha.  \n \nHigh-quality poetry was not the final writing outcome of the creative project. \nIt was one of many different written responses to the novel, part of a \ncontinuum of writing that flowed around the novel and through work in drama.  \n \n \nA village in Bangladesh \n \n \nThis is Rahela’s watercolour painting of a Bangladesh village. The class made \nthese painting using what they learned from searching the internet, watching a \nvideo and from the novel itself. Around this image, they created a border of \nlyrical, descriptive statements. The words surround all four sides of the \npainting.  \n \nIn Rahel’a panting, the text further illuminates her understanding of the home \nof the novel’s protagonist, Aysha. Rahela used her own memories of Bangladesh \nfor this writing and painting.   \n \nFrightened small afraid white shy sheep \nLong swishing vivid grass  \nLarge black scary crows that croak \n \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n135 \nTired hungry people working in the muddy fields \n \nCool pool with fishes dancing where I swam \nDry muddy square houses with hay roofs \n \nDisobedient shouting unpleasant ducks \nMessy goats that leave their droppings everywhere  \nAnd nibble grass \n \nGloomy cloudy sky that is grey \nJuicy yummy small banana trees that stand up \n \nRahela’s watercolour painting in the centre of the A3 page shows an \nagricultural space, verdant and quiet. The whole text is highly decorative. The \nwords, the artwork and the calligraphy itself all have equal importance. The \nsentences are poetry, and surround the central image on all four sides in wavy, \ndreamlike lines. \n \nThe artwork is a visual backdrop for Rahela’s dramatic work around the novel.  \nThere is a sense of sadness and loss in the painting and in the words. The \npainting shows an empty expanse of field surrounded by village homes. Small \nfigures of people sparsely dot the field. Black birds fly around in the sky. The \nwords convey a sense of anxiety and describe the fictional Aysha’s \npsychological frame of mind: frightened, small, afraid, tired, hungry, \ndisobedient, shouting, unpleasant.          \n \nRahela has a strong sense of the audience as readers and as viewers. She is \nhelping us to build a mental picture of this place and the feelings it evokes. It \nis as if we are looking through a window onto this village, or standing in the \nwide empty space of the field. There is a tension between the words and the \nimage and they each make demands on the reader. We are drawn into the \nvillage but the words pull away at our gaze, just as the birds in the picture are \nflying away. The multimodal text is thoughtful and tentative. The whole story, \nbeyond the borders of the picture and the frame of the words, is not yet \nrevealed.     \n \nThe purpose of this text is to telegraph, in words and images, a memory of a \nvillage. This is a not a draft, but a form of high-level participation in the world \nof the text. Words convey deep feelings as well as information about this place. \nIt is a poetic meditation, and - like Rahela’s poem - it is a pause in the \nnarrative of the novel where we look around, hear, see and smell this village. \nThis text powerfully and simultaneously shows and tells in a non-linear, non-\nnarrative mode.  \n \nThe influences of Rahela’s creative arts experiences are evident in the careful \nuse of art techniques and media, and in the dramatic and visual explorations of \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n136 \nthis fictional world.  In her multimedia text, Rahela has used her knowledge of \nthe class novel, her knowledge of how to work dramatically in role, and her \nown experiences in the creation of school texts.  \n \nMake the writing beautiful for the picture \nA multimedia story  \nAmina, Year 4, School F \n(Class Study Three) \n \nAmina is a refugee from Somlia who arrived recently in Year 4. Her parents \nspeak limited English. At first Amina struggled to express herself orally but \nquickly gained confidence in speaking. She continues to find written work \nchallenging as she was also learning a new script in school.    \n \nAmina’s Sense Story is a 4-frame powerpoint presentation that combines \nmanipulated images of her artwork (a background of red and blue crayon \nsquiggles, a clay model, a drawing of a brown nut-like shape and a drawing of a \nblond girl) a photograph of Amina herself in a drama workshop and electronic \nsound effects. The words themselves are animated, fading in and out and \nmoving within the text box space.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI jumped up and ran as fast as \nlightning. The darkness lifted and I \nsaw the snakes. They looked \ndangerous. I tried to tiptoe away \nquietly but I heard a bang above. I was \nfrightened that the snakes may wake \nup. I looked up and saw a huge nut \nheading for the biggest snake pile.\nIt was a cold night,the wind was blowing hard.  I \nheard a hissing sound, so I crept  slowly into a dark \ncorner.  As I searched around, I bumped into a \nstrange hard object, it felt like sleeping snakes in a \nbundle . \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n137 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAmina wrote her story after multi-sensory workshops, related preparatory \nwriting and a drama workshop where she moved through her imaginary \nlandscape. Her preparatory writing followed a sound workshop and described \nthis landscape (Class Study Three).  \n \nAmina wrote at length in her preparatory writing, but this was not incorporated \ninto the framework of the final story. Like other children, Amina seemed \nconstrained by the limited space for text in the powerpoint slides. However \nAmina does use fragments of the preparatory writing in her final story: a \n‘buzzing sound’ becomes a ‘hissing sound’; I saw the wind push the wavy grass \nbecomes the less complex the wind was blowing hard. \n \nAmina alters her visual landscape across the four slides. She changes the colour \nof her clay model and replicates it several times across the screen. In frame \nnumber two a ‘huge nut’ rolls into the scene. In frame number three a new \ncharacter enters, a drawing of a blond-haired girl. Throughout the four slides, \nAmina herself appears to dance and weave around the artwork.  \n \nAmina writes in the first person. It is a simple narrative without character \ndevelopment or inner psychological action: she is in a slightly sinister fantasy \nlandscape, she meets snakes and a girl. Amina said that ‘because it was ME, I \nwas in it...it would be much more better.’ For Amina, the story is not ‘about’ \nher, it is her. She is literally in the world of her text. She has written the story \nfor herself and her peers; there is no awareness of a wider audience.    \n \n \n \n \nAs I swerved to avoid the snakes a \ngirl jumped out in front of me and \ngrabbed the nut.  She giggled at me \nand ran away.\nThe snakes rolled after me and I ran as fast as I \ncould, but I tripped over a bright red squiggle on \nthe ground . The snakes rolled past me and \ncarried on. They were chasing  the girl after all.\n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n138 \nAmina had one-to-one support for her writing, where an adult helped her find \nwords such as ‘swerved’ and develop literary phrases (the darkness lifted). \nAmina uses her artwork to inform her writing. She turns her clay model into \nsleeping snakes in a bundle. She refers directly to her background drawing (I \ntripped over a bright red squiggle). Her story is playful.   \n \nBut the fanciful quality of the story belies the struggle Amina had in writing it. \nAmina needed substantial support in writing her Sense Story.  She wasn’t sure \nwhat to do even though the task appeared straightforward: to write a story to \ngo with the series of pictures.  Amina tried to create a narrative for her \nimages. Initially she thought her pictures and story would be about a jungle.   \n  \nWhen I was writing the story I was thinking about how to make the \npicture and the writing go together. I thought, if the picture is about a \njungle, the writing could be about the jungle. I found putting it together \nhard.  I had to make the pictures part of the writing… I was saying to \nmyself, I have to try and make the writing beautiful for the picture. \n(Amina, Year 4) \n  \nThe pictures seem to create barriers rather than free-up her writing. Amina \nstruggled to ‘make the pictures and the writing go together’.  Her storyline \nbecame set at the point where she decided that her clay model looked like a \nbundle of snakes. Amina’s images are stronger than her writing, and she is \naware of this (I have to try and make the writing beautiful for the picture).     \n \nThe skills evident in Amina’s text are mainly computer skills. There is no \nequivalent evidence of skills development in artwork.  Amina had an \nexperience that offered much input but little development. The project was \nopen, with many different stimuli and freedom to respond spontaneously, but \nat the same time it was constrained by a narrow writing framework.  \n \nAmina’s story may have been hindered by the stated aim of the creative \nproject: to inspire children to write. This could imply that it didn’t matter \nwhat Amina wrote as long as she wrote something. Ideas in this context don’t \nhave to count for much. Sinker (2000) has described this lack of expectation as \npart of the “chameleon character” of multimedia: \n \n ...a tool for writing, reading, talking and listening, a tool for drawing \nand looking, a tool for animating and viewing, and a tool for gaming, \ninteracting and consuming – makes it less easy to gauge in evaluative \nterms..[T]he very fact that there is no overall model for evaluating \nmultimedia work...makes it a liberating experience for young \npeople...Not because they have some natural inclination towards this way \nof working...It is much more to do with expectations, or lack of them. \n \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n139 \nAmina took great pride in her multimedia presentation. Because it is not unlike \nall the other Sense Stories, Amina was doing the same level of work as the \nother children. This type of multimedia project with its diverse elements may \nbe part of the learning curve of creative projects involving ICT in schools. As \nSinker (ibid.) observed, and as this case study demonstrates, multimedia is not \njudged in the same way as writing or drawing, yet it can be significant in \nproducing in children like Amina a real sense of achievement and confidence.   \n  \n The Bully \nA storyboard for a film \nJahura, Year 5, School A  \n(Class Study Four) \n \nJahura is an Asian heritage child in Year 5. She dresses modestly in school but \ndoes not wear a headscarf. Before the filmmaking project, class relationships \nwere unsupportive and she was often reluctant to speak for fear of being \nridiculed. She said the filmmaking project transformed how she felt about \nspeaking.  \n \n Before I was kind of quiet, I couldn’t really speak that loud, I was shy. \nAfter we finished the film I felt louder, my voice projected and I wasn’t \nreally shy. I was happy and confident to speak, not embarrassed. \n(Jahura, Year 5) \n \nJahura said she ‘really liked acting and doing drama’ in the filmmaking \nproject. She admitted that ‘I don’t usually do that at my house because I’ve \ngot four sisters and I’m doing housework.’ She said that because of the project \nshe would now like to be a film director.  \n \nI liked to use the camera. The first time I used the camera I didn’t know \nhow to put the camera on and use the different shots. Now I know how \nto turn the camera on and do it. The tripod, when I was working with \n[arts partner] F, she showed me how to use it. It made me feel like a \nproper person. (Jahura, Year 5) \n \nJahura was excited when the four films were shown at a local cinema because \nshe had never been in a cinema before. \n \nWhen Jahura’s wrote this storyboard the films were still in development. \nJahura’s text is part of exploratory thinking and writing about the film that also \nincluded role play, writing in role, poetry, dialogues and scripts.  \n \nJahura created a storyboard for a film which she titled The Bully. It depicts \nwhat must be a routine playground incident, so authentically is it shown and \ntold. From the upper floor of the school building, a girl (the narrator) spies her \nfriend below in the playground. She sees that some one is with her friend, but \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n140 \nthis character is partially hidden behind a tree. It may be the bully. She waves \nbut they ignore her. She goes down to the playground to meet her friend. They \nlaugh at her and the friend tells her to go away. In a close-up, the girl wonders \nwhat is happening. The bully throws the girl’s book bag on the ground and all \nthe books spill out. The girl picks up her books as the bully looks on.    \n \n \n \nJahura’s storyboard clearly draws on all her previous experiences. She is \nthinking of what the film will look like. She combines her knowledge of film as \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n141 \na medium, drawings and writing. Her skills in the techniques of filmmaking are \nevident, as are the facial expressions and body language of drama and role play \nwork.   \n \nJahura’s storyboard is sophisticated. She includes a camera direction (WS, CS, \nMS,) in each frame, and each frame shows a powerful and distinct camera point \nof view: above the playground, on either side of the tree, a close-up, a wide \nshot. Jahura does not need a synopsis because her storyboard tells everything \nvisually with only a skeleton written narrative beneath each picture. Jahura \ncreated this text with enthusiasm and commitment - even though a film of her \nstory was never made. The storyboard was part of Jahura’s exploratory writing \nas the class developed ideas for their films. \n \nJahura’s imaginative engagement in this text is powerful. In spite of the limits \nof the 8-frame paper medium, the theme of the story comes across strongly. \nJahura’s written language shows evidence of her experiences in the creative \nproject, in the camera direction, in the dramatic story and in the internal \nreflection of the narrator. Frame 5 is a dramatic pause in the narrative, a \nclose-up shot, in which the character ponders what has happened to her best \nfriend.  \n \nJahura’s text is effective and it does a job. It conveys meaning in pictures and \nwriting, and a film could be made from her storyboard. Jahura takes three \ndistinct stances as the writer of this text: the scriptwriter creating a working \ndocument, the camera shooter looking through the lens, and the first-person \nnarrator in the writing. There is a very strong awareness of the point of view of \nthe main character, the crew that will shoot this film, and of the film audience \nitself.  \n \n         \n \nA film: Shame \nBoys in Year 5, School A \n \nThis short film was one of a group of four films made by a groups of children in \nSchool A (Class study Four in Chapter 3) in partnership with filmmaker NB and \nher colleagues. Like other films made in this project it is based in the \nplayground, and is a pupils’ eye view of school life. It deals with relationships \nbetween pupils, the hard reality of ‘play’, and authority relationships between \nteachers and pupils which are sometimes experienced as arbitrary or biased by \nchildren. Above all this film is a fully realised study of one troubled boy, \nCameron, and of the factors that push him to make trouble.  \n \nThe film begins with a playtime football match. Cameron is trying to get the \nball and accidentally kicks it high against the school building where it smashes \na window. This incurs the fear, blame and anger of the other boys who attack \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n142 \nhim. When he fights back, the teacher spots him and sends him to ‘sit out’ by \nthe wall. He lingers by the corner of the wall behind the goal, and the game \nresumes. One of his friends commiserates with him and he blames the teacher: \n‘She’s banned me. I could be in goal, yeah, because That Stupid Goalie Over \nThere is rubbish.’ The friend tries to comfort Cameron by telling him that he’s \nonly banned for the afternoon. Left to himself, Cameron investigates a cavity \nin the wall and finds a stone.  \n \nMeanwhile, around the corner, visible to the camera, the goalie defends the \ngoal ineptly. Cameron wanders round the corner as the goalie lets two goal \nkicks through; he puts his hand on the goal proprietarily, and his foot on the \nball, doing all he can to distract and intimidate the goalie. When the play \nrecedes, he taunts him: ‘You’re rubbish in goal’, and continues to jeer while \nthe goalie tries to ignore him. Finally, exasperated, Cameron throws the stone \nat the goalie’s head. The goalie puts up his arms to protect himself and at that \nmoment the ball hits him in the stomach. The goalie doubles up in pain on the \nground as his classmates look on aghast. Cameron ducks under the goal and \nstrolls past the goalie’s prone body, muttering sarcastically ‘Shame!’ (as in \n‘Too bad you didn’t stop that goal’) . Cameron’s friend challenges him:  \n‘What did you do that for man?’ \n‘Because I wanted to.’ \n‘You really hurted him!’ \n‘So, do I care?’ \nAs Cameron walks off by himself the teacher summons him and the last few \nmoments of the film are shot from the teacher’s viewpoint as Cameron \napproaches her reluctantly across the playground, saying: ‘You always blame \nme…Why man, it’s not fair…you always do it’. The last shot of the film looks \ndown on his sullen, resigned face. \n \nThis film, like the others made by the class, is an economical cameo of what \nthe pupils’ side of life in school can be like. It shows the tough culture of the \nplayground, the teasing, taunting and bullying that goes on between pupils, and \nthe sudden bursts of temper that can end in violence. It shows how pupils \nexperience teachers’ authority: Cameron’s brooding presence by the wall is \nliterally, visually red with his burning sense of injustice.  \n \nTechnically the film is well thought out, using its location ingeniously and \neffectively. The fact that the goal is near the corner of a brick wall in the \nplayground allows the camera to cut between Cameron’s isolation around the \ncorner and the action of the children’s play; sometimes we see two aspects \nwithin the same shot, as when Cameron is kicking a stone (foreshadowing the \nlater incident) while the goalie attempts to cover the goal. The action of the \nfootball game, rushing away from the goal so that we can focus on the \ninteraction between Cameron and goalie, and rushing back to create a \ndramatic climax, is very well managed. Point of view is used, in the scenes \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n143 \nwith the teacher, in a way that is strongly expressive of the way Cameron sees \nthe adult world – powerful and unsympathetic.  \n \nThis film gives a remarkable glimpse of one episode in a boy’s school life, and \nhas great resonance; it goes on working beyond the final frame. Cameron’s \nface lives in the memory because the film seems to catch something about him, \nand about what he might become. Cameron is the kind of boy who is unable to \nget out of the hole he digs for himself, he is unhappy but he can’t see another \nway to be. He seems to be in the process of isolating himself and damaging his \nown chances and there is something ominous about his story.  \n \nThis is a short film but it has a strong plot based on accurate psychology and \nlived experiences. The film is well imagined visually and technically impressive, \nand it is realised in very good performances. The film grew from other learning \nin drama, role play, improvisation, drawing, writing and film study. As well as \ndevising the plot, storyboarding the film and writing the shooting script, the \ngroup of children acted and took the roles of camera operators, sound \noperators, and director’s understudy. Film as a medium has allowed the class \nto combine many different ways of making meaning. Although adult editing has \nobviously made the most of what the children did, the underlying material and \nthe idea for its visual treatment are what make the film special.   \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n144 \nMany routes to meaning \nThese five very different texts show how literacy learning may be woven into \nthe fabric of creative arts projects. Through work in the creative arts, children \ntook on different voices and stances as writers. They had strong imaginative \nengagement with the work and with the writing that arose from it. They wrote \nwith commitment and purpose.  \n \nJahura’s storyboard, Rahela’s poem and painting and the boys’ film all show \nstrong evidence of their work in creative projects. They use their experiences \nand skills to select and inform their mode of expression. Jahura’s writing is \neconomical: she conveys her meaning decisively through shifting visual points \nof view as well as through narration. Rahela paints a picture of a village in \nBangladesh in images and in words; her combination of modes has a strong \nimpact on the reader-viewer. The boys who made the film Shame use their \nknowledge and skills in drama, film study and camera technique to tell a tough, \nuncompromising story where words convey only a superficial meaning. Some of \nthese texts are still in development, and children sometimes struggled with the \nforms of expression. Amina found it hard to create writing that she felt would \ndo justice to her images.  \n \nThe more experience children had in the working practices of the creative art \nform, the more evident this knowledge and these experiences were in their \nwriting. Powerful writing did not come at the end of creative arts projects, as a \nway to demonstrate children’s learning or understanding. In the projects from \nwhich these four texts arose, writing was part of a learning processes; writing \nin different modes was a form of thinking. Children had time to talk and \nreflect, to move between practical work and exploratory writing. They also had \nopportunities to express meaning in other, non-verbal modes: in visual art, in \nsketches and drawings, in facial expressions and body language, in storyboards \nand camera viewpoints. Children needed extensive opportunities to explore \nthemes in different modes before they could create whole, convincing texts \nthat reflected their work in creative arts projects.      \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n145 \n \n  \n \n \n \n       Chapter 7 \n \n The power of story and literature in children’s \n creative arts work \n \n \n \nWhen I read, it just comes when you read what you have to do. When \nyou read, ideas just come into your head. You just write it down, it \nmakes a good story. (Kiah, Year 5) \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n146 \n \nCreative arts projects, reading and writing \nThe impact of whole texts on children’s work in creative arts projects appeared \nto be significant. In classrooms where creative arts work emerged from stories \nand literature, children recalled both the process and the outcome of this work \nvividly and in great detail, calling on their knowledge of the texts to do so. \nTeacher knowledge and practice created and sustained this learning.   \n \nReading however was central to only one of the ten creative arts projects.  \nClass Study One describes the impact on children’s literacy of working \nextensively around a literary text. This was the only project to work in this way \nand also the only one where children produced a consistent and significant \namount of quality writing.  \n \nOther teachers did not make reading and extensive work around a text the \nfocus of the creative arts project, although some projects referred to \nchildren’s literature. In School J, children made sculptures of characters and \nscenes from the novels Krindlekrax by Phillip Pullman and Charlie and the \nChocolate Factory by Roald Dahl. In School B, children danced an interpretation \nof a poem (Body Talk by Benjamin Zephaniah) and a story (Jamil’s Clever Cat \nby Fiona French). In these situations texts were used as a stimulus for artwork.  \n \nTeachers were chiefly concerned about children’s writing abilities; there was \nless concern about children’s reading. Many teachers hoped to see \nimprovements in children’s writing as a result of creative arts projects. In \neffective projects, children were able to make strong connections between \nreading, writing and work in the creative arts.   \n \nStoryworlds \nStorytelling, which could also involve enactment and visual art work, supported \nchildren’s imaginative engagement in literacy through visualisation, role play, \ndrawing, craft-work and performance.  \n \nTeacher AO worked with storyteller JB over two projects, in School E which has \na high proportion of children with English as an Additional Language. These \nprojects were supported by a national performing arts centre which included a \npoetry library.  \n \nThe first project involved extended storytelling work with Year 2 for three \nterms. JB initially asked children to draw a picture of a story. In this \nobservation, Felipe in Year 2 is drawing such a picture. His first language is \nPortuguese. As he draws, he tells the story behind the picture. He is creating a \nstoryworld visually and orally:  \n \n \n \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n147 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOne day my dad came to my house and my grandfather came. They \nstarted to have a fight because my grandfather doesn’t like my dad \ncoming to my house at Portugal. [draws incline of steep hill] That’s a \nrocky place where trucks go, where they cut the trees. [draws curving \nroad] My grandmother has animals down here. Pig, chickens, some \nrabbits. Then my dad had some friends in his car and they came out to \nstop the fight. They took my dad in the car and they went away. But then \nmy grandfather just had something in his hand – a hard thing, it was made \nof metal. And it broke the window of my dad’s car. Finish!  My dad still \nlives at Portugal. I’m gonna meet him in the holidays. He’s gonna pick me \nup at the airport. He has a white car, dark windows. \n \nFelipe is creating a story-world with pictures and language. He moves straight \ninto storytelling mode as he begins to draw. Felipe talks partly to himself, and \npartly to the observer who is present. His talk recalls the monologues that \nyoung children are sometimes observed to engage in when playing alone – but \nwith an adult nearby. This being ‘alone in the presence of someone’ can be \nhelpful to children in expressing their thoughts and imaginings. \n \nFelipe’s account of an actual dramatic (and unsettling) incident from his family \nlife in Portugal has a clear narrative development, and he recalls all its stages. \nThe event he is remembering evidently made a big impression on him. As JB \nobserved:  \n \n ‘Stories are a way to describe what is happening to you.’  \n \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n148 \n \nFelipe ends his story with a flourish (‘Finish!’) and adds a coda (My dad still \nlives at Portugal…’).  \n \nAs Felipe talks, however, he is drawing all the time, and in the middle of his \nstorytelling he pauses to focus on his drawing of the landscape. This landscape \nis more than just the background to the story, it shows what Felipe’s family life \nis like in rural Portugal:  \n \n‘That’s a rocky place where trucks go, where they cut the trees. My \ngrandmother has animals down here. Pig, chickens, some rabbits’.  \n \nTalk and drawing are mutually supportive throughout this activity: Felipe’s talk \nhelps him to shape his drawing, just as the picture that he is creating supports \nhim in describing his experience and telling his story. In class, Felipe normally \nstruggled with writing. Yet he has a compelling story to tell. Teacher AO said \nshe learned a lot about Felipe and other children by listening to them talk \nabout their drawings, and she also learned about the writing process: \n \nI found out there was a huge amount of pre-writing, before writing. It \nmade me think about everything that must be going on in their heads.  \n \nSome children in this class constructed storyworlds that began with their own \nexperience but then sent the narrative in imaginary directions. JB modelled \nthis type of story as “Usually I get up and go to work, but one day something \nunusual happened…” \n \nStory quest \nJB also showed the Year 2 children a ‘Story Quest’ structure to help them tell \nand then write their own stories. She shares this same concept in workshops for \ncorporate clients who want to overcome adversity in their work lives. Like the \nstoryboards in Class Study Four, the Story Quest framework works differently to \na story ‘ladder’ or other linear writing frameworks that demand a beginning, a \nmiddle and an ending. JB’s structure is more fluid. Each part is necessary for a \n‘good’ story. Children could see the whole shape of the story before they began \nworking on the parts.  \n \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n149 \n \n \n \nThey could access the map, they could structure and see their stories, \nget the stories inside them, hear the voice inside them, get the story-\nvoice. (Arts partner JB) \n  \nChildren used the Story Quest framework to write about all sorts of \ncircumstances in their own lives. They conquered their fears in stories. One girl \nlearned how to swim. A boy learned to spell by slicing words into manageable \nparts with his magical sword. Mina achieved her goal of getting a good report \nfrom her teacher:  \n \nThe Queen of Thinking \nOnce upon a time there lived a girl who wanted to become the Queen of \nThinking. Her name was Mina. One day Mina said, ‘That’s it! I’ve got to \nbehave and get a ‘5’ for my report.’ So she told the teacher but the \nteacher said, ‘I am a magic teacher and that is a secret’. So this is what \nshe did. She pulled her ear and she felt as if she knew every single \ninstruction. Mina was never behaving and she always sat by the door. \nThat week she tried everything. She followed instructions. She sat on \nthe carpet quietly. She did everything the teacher told her. At last \nFriday came. When Mina looked at her report she was shocked. She had \na ‘5’! Mina had achieved her goal! She went home very happy indeed. \nThe end. \n \nIn her writing Mina has used JB’s ‘Story Quest’ to confront obstacles and \novercome them. It is a brief story, but full of detail. She is addressing readers \nand we can hear Mina’s voice clearly. She has used story language (eg Once \nupon a time there lived a girl) which is approaching literary language. She has \ncreated a world where her story takes place. Her school, classroom and teacher \ntake on magical qualities.  \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n150 \nYet we may wonder what Mina’s story reveals about her school experiences. \nMina was ‘never behaving’. She seems to spend a lot of time ‘sitting by the \ndoor’ excluded from the class. Mina must figure out for herself how to succeed. \nHer goal is to behave and get a ‘5’ on her weekly behaviour report by doing \neverything the teacher tells her and by sitting quietly.  \n \nCreating a community \nTeacher AO said the storytelling project ‘enriched our life as a class \ncommunity’. Children brought stories they had written at home to class. A \nlarge bulletin board displayed children’s writing, drawings notes, story maps \nand diagrams from home.  \n \nChildren became storytellers and performers through working with JB. They \nemulated her style and language, her vocal cadences and rhythms. When \nBlessing told the story of The Boy Who Cried Wolf she drew on everything JB \nhad modelled.  \n \nBlessing used facial dramatic expressions, she used her hands to \ngesticulate, she clapped her hands as she slammed the door, the tone of \nher voice rose with shouts for help and lowered on notes of warning. \n(Teacher AO) \n \nTeacher AO observed children’s oral language become more sophisticated as \nthey heard and told stories. She was fascinated when children said that JB had \nalso taught them how to read and write.   \n \nBlessing said that Jan taught her how to read and write. But the \nsessions rarely included much formal writing and certainly no reading! \nStorytelling motivated Blessing to read and write. But the project was \nan exploration into unknown territory. Now that I understand that \nterritory a little better I wonder whether I can develop a map and a \nstructure in order to capitalise on what I learned and reproduce it with \nother children. (Teacher AO) \n \nTeacher AO did have this opportunity, with a different class and in a shorter \ntime period.  \n \nStorytelling, crafting and writing \nTeacher AO and storyteller JB worked together on a second project, with Year \n5 and Year 6 children. This was a one-term storytelling project where children \nalso worked with a visual artist to make storyboxes (shoebox-size 3-D scenes) \nillustrating traditional tales. Children’s artwork and writing were displayed to \nthe public as part of a children’s literature festival. \n  \n \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n151 \nTo begin, Teacher AO and JB helped children to internalise stories through \nretelling them with props and ‘freeze framing’ tableaux of different scenes. \nSmall groups of children enacted sequences of scenes from two stories: Snake \nMagic from West Africa and Hans Christian Anderson’s The Swineheard.   \n \nChildren then made storyboxes illustrating their scenes. They used pipecleaners \nand fabric to make tiny figures of people and animals. They made trees, \nhouses, huts, fields of pumpkins, rivers and forests using colourful cloth, straw, \nsticks, and a range of other collage materials. As they worked, JB told and re-\ntold the stories and reminded children to think about what was happening in \ntheir scene of the story: \n \nYou can’t have a picnic because there is no picnic in your scene [of The \nSwineherd]. It can’t be snowing because, remember, in the story the \nrose trees are in bloom. Think about what is going on in your part of the \nstory. (Arts partner JB)  \n \nCrafting a storyworld was powerful for these children. They acquired stories \nand story telling skills as they acquired design and making skills.  Art became a \nphysical manifestation of their knowledge of the stories, and they took \nownership of both the stories and the artwork. Kara in Year 5 showed her story-\nbox scene from the African tale Snake Magic, where the princess is selling \npumpkins and sees her wicked brother:  \n \nThese are the customers, and these people are selling pumpkins. My \nscene is the bit when she sells the pumpkins. One of these people is the \nbrother. He – in the next scene – he chops her hand off! Scary! It’s not \nvery nice. [sees one model is missing] Oh no! The brother is gone! I need \nhim! She [the princess] is clever – she climbs the tree with her one \nhand.(Kara, Year 5) \n \nKara knows the sequence of the story perfectly. In her mind she sees it unfold \nscene by scene. She expresses her feeling of possession of the story and ‘her’ \nscene which she has enacted and now made three-dimensional. She moves back \nand forth between the story in her head (in the next scene he chops off her \nhand) and her model of the story (The brother is missing!). \n \n Kara was able to tell the entire story of Snake Magic in great detail and with \nexpression. Children like Kara used their storytelling, enacting, making and \ncrafting experiences to move on to writing. Their writing reflected their \ninternalisation of story language. They wrote about the scenes they had \ncreated in the voices of the characters they had enacted. \n \n \n \n \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n152 \nMy Story \nI felt sad when I left the palace with only my baby boy and a pot. In the \nforest I saw a snake. He asked me ‘Would you let me hide in your pot?’ \n‘Yes.’ So he slid quietly into the pot. There appeared another snake \nasking ‘Where is my brother?’ I said ‘He went that way’ and the snake \nslithered away. Then the snake crept out of the pot. He said, ‘Thank \nyou for saving my life’. Then he cried ‘Come with me to the Kingdom of \nSnakes’. On the journey we stopped at a beautiful clear pond to rest. \nThere I walked with my little boy to the cool water. (by Sofia as the \nPrincess in Snake Magic) \n \nMy Story \nI’m smart with my clothes you know. My shoes are black and brand new. \nOh, did you see my gloves? They’re bright yellow. Anyway I needed some \nfresh air. I went to the balcony and opened the window to see the view \nin the garden. Hmmmm, I wonder why there is a crowd next to the \npigsty. I’d better go and find out, I said to myself, and I walked across \nthe grass. I said as loud as I could ‘Why is there a crowd next to the \npigsty?’ What do you think I saw? Oh my goodness! What do you think \nyou’re doing? My daughter was kissing the swineherd! ‘Get out! Get out! \nYou’re banished from the city and I mean it!’ I cried. (by Rafael as the \nEmperor in The Swineherd) \n \nAlthough these two stories come from very different cultures, they are linked \nby the powerful theme of banishment, and JB’s Story Quest framework is very \nmuch in evidence as characters encounter obstacles and ultimately triumph. \n \nIn their writing, children are moving away from language that is close to \neveryday speech and they begin use literary, written language forms. Sophia \nwrites lyrically: Then he cried ‘Come with me to the kingdom of snakes’… On \nthe journey we stopped…There I walked with my little boy to the cool water. \nRafael writes as a more bumptious character: Oh, did you see my gloves?...I’d \nbetter go and find out, I said to myself…What do you think I saw?  Children \nhave physically enacted the story, and they have moved on to tell it and then \nwrite it. Children have taken on the voice and stance of imaginary characters, \nand they have also taken on the voice and stance of the storyteller.   \n \nStorytelling, story writing and sculpture    \nTeachers in School I also observed the influence of stories on children’s \ncreative work. In this school, Key Stage 1 children made giant tree sculptures \nto transform the school dinner hall. Each giant tree sculpture is unique, \ndecorated with children’s artwork, drawings, collage and paintings. They made \nthe trees after listening to traditional tales by a storyteller who encouraged \nchildren to re-tell the stories and, like JB in School E, to become storytellers \nthemselves. Storyteller PP also encouraged them to use their story ideas for \ntheir artwork. \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n153 \n  \nThat’s the end of my story. I hope it’s given you lots of idea for the work \nyou’re going to be doing with [arts partner] G, and I hope you enjoyed it. \nNow you can tell somebody else the stories. (Arts partner PP) \n \nPP returned at the end of the project to re-tell the stories under the giant \ntrees.  \n \nThe story-teller was amazed that the Reception children remembered \nstories from a year earlier. One child said, ‘But last time you said it was a \ndifferent animal!’  (Teacher RM)  \n \nThe large-scale artwork and traditional tales became the starting point for \nstory-telling and story writing across the whole school. Key Stage 1 children re-\ntold traditional tales to Key Stage 2 children, who then wrote their own \nversions of these stories. \n \nWe hadn’t thought about the story element, since our project was very \nart-based. The stories just grew. It naturally evolved.(Teacher RM) \nThe Junior children wrote their stories, and when they went back to the \nInfants to read their stories, the Infants were saying – but our story \nwasn’t like that! We said, they [Juniors] listened to your version, now \ntheirs is a version with more detail. That is how stories grow. The young \nchildren got something out of that. For the older children, every person \nin the class, including the four children with statements, could say ‘This \nis ours, this is our story.’ It was ownership.(Teacher CJ)  \n \nAt the end of the project, each giant tree in the dinner hall had a name:  The \nAutumn Tree, The Whispering Tree, The Chinese Tree, The Family Tree, The \nFlower Tree, The  Fairy Tree, The Rainforest Tree, The Monkey Tree, The \nWinter Tree. Each tree had a book of tales written for it.  \n \nThe Whispering Trees \nA long, long time ago there was an axe man. He had lived in the Garden \nof Eden but he had been removed. He wanted to chop some wood for to \nbuild a house and for a fire. So he went searching for some trees. Firstly \nhe found a pine tree. It was very tall and thin. He was lifting his axe \nwhen, ‘NO! Don’t cut me down! Or I will cry enormous sticky tears and \nyou won’t be able to make a fire!’ So the axe man went further into the \nforest. He found a spruce tree. He was lifting his axe when, ‘NO! Don’t \ncut me down! I am twisted and tangled so you can’t use me to build a \nhouse!’ So the axe man went deeper into the forest… \n(by Joe, Year 4)     \n \nJoe, like Mina and Sofia, is beginning to use story language confidently in his \nwriting. His story continues in the same literary rhythm; words and phrases are \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n154 \nrepeated, built-up and embellished. Using patterns of language, and with the \nthree-dimensional model of the tree in his mind, he has created a story world \nwhere trees can talk.  \n   \nChildren’s literature and creative projects  \nChildren showed a high level of recall and enthusiasm where creative projects \ninvolved literature. When children were familiar with a text they had the world \nof the story in their minds. This helped them visualise what their creative \nproject would look like.  \n \nChildren who learnt skills or techniques to create ‘stand alone’ art did not \nappear to show the same level of recall as children whose work was based on a \nfamiliar book or story. Children enjoyed both types of creative work, but a \nliterary or a story aspect appeared to be a memorable path into creative \nactivity for children. One headteacher described this as “the difference \nbetween an art lesson and a holistic, creative experience”. This difference is \nillustrated by groups of Year 4 and 5 children in School J who worked with the \nsame arts partners.  \n \nThe first group of children had made 12-inch 3-D sculptures of athletes, and \nthis work was linked to their PE topic of taking weight on different body parts. \nBut none of the children interviewed recalled doing any writing connected to \nthis work – even though their poems about their sculptures were on display \noutside the headteacher’s office! Children described this project as “always a \nsurprise” and “different every day” because “we didn’t know what was going \nto happen”. Although children enjoyed making the sculptures they did not \nseem to know where this artwork was going; as they worked, they could not \nvisualise the finished sculpture in their heads.  Their teacher also said that the \nlink between the sculpture, the PE topic and writing poetry was not clear to \nchildren. \n \nThe second and third groups of children in this school made 3-D sculptures \nbased on their earlier readings of two novels: Charlie and the Chocolate \nFactory by Roald Dahl and Krindlekrax by Phillip Pullman. These children \nrecalled their work in detail, often using their knowledge of the stories. The \nvisiting artist’s ideas for sculpture were enhanced by the teachers’ knowledge \nof what would create the most favourable context for children’s learning.   \n \n[CLPE: how did you get the idea for how the ‘Krindlekrax’ sculpture \nwas going to look?]  \n \nMax., Year 5: From the story really cos the words just come into \nyour head and it gives you a good picture.  \n \nJasmine., Year 5: Yeah so we decided which part of the story we \nwanted to do, how we wanted to put Krindledrax. Did we want to \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n155 \nput it on the road? Did we want to put it under the sewer? Mine was \ncoming out of a pipe into the sewer. Some of the tail was in the \nwater and the rest was hanging out.  \n \nUnlike the ‘athletes’ artwork, these sculptures had a memorable, literary \ncontext. Using their knowledge of the story, children were able see the path \ntowards the final art product because, as several children said, “I had the story \nstuck in my head so I knew what it would look like.” Their teachers also \nnoticed the strong interaction between the novel and the artwork.  \n \nIt was memorable for them. [For Krindlekrax] we made cobblestone \nstreets of clay, and they could actually see and feel them, touch them, \nand then talk and write about them with more conviction and \nunderstanding… It was good to work from a book or a story. It made sense \nto them. It was all connected. Better than just an art lesson. I’m going to \nincorporate it into my Literacy next year. (Year 3 Teacher SD) \n \n When they know the setting of the book, they can use it in their artwork. \nThey enjoyed it. They each had their own model of Krindlekrax and they \nwere surprised at how each one was so different. They took it further, \nthey wanted to make the setting as well as the model of Krindlekrax. \n(Year 3 Teacher JB) \n \nSophia and Louisa in Year 5 worked on a sculpture based on Charlie & the \nChocolate Factory. This was an enormous (two by four metres) collaborative \npiece, illustrating a key scene in the novel. Children began by sketching the \nnovel’s characters. They then made armature of wire where they translated \ntheir 2D sketches into 3D models of bodies. The armature was covered in \nmudrock and painted. The novel’s cast of characters were set in Willie Wonka’s \ngarden, with a chocolate river flowing around trees and flowers made from real \nsweets.  \n \nThe novel and the sculpture were not separate experiences for Sophie and \nLouisa. Each form of communication influenced the other. In a conversation, \nthey described their improvements in art techniques and in writing as a result \nof work in sculpture. \n \nSophie: We wanted to make a version of the novel to go with the model, \nlike a shorter one that we could attach to the model and people could \nread it at the same time they looked at it, for people who don’t know the \nstory. \n \nLouisa: When we were making the model, we would look back – leaf back \n– into the book to get ideas for what it could look like. \n \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n156 \nSophie: When I’m in secondary school I will know how to use these tools \nand materials. And I’ll remember the wonderful story – the most \nwonderful bit, our favourite bit – the candy river and garden. It’s stuck in \nmy head. Doing it helped with my writing, to get everything in, to \ndescribe everything. \n \nLouisa: Instead of just saying ‘there was trees and a river’ now you say \n‘there was a gorgeous chocolate river and grass that melted like mint in \nyour mouth.’ \n \nJoseph in Year 5 described how reading helps him to visualise his art work, both \nin specific school projects like his model of Willie Wonka for the Charlie and \nthe Chocolate Factory sculpture and in his own, free drawing and modelling: \n \nFirst you’ve read the story, you’ve got descriptions, you can think ‘this \nis how his round body would go’. But if you just draw it out [without \nreading], you might miss something out. It would all be new, I wouldn’t \nknow how to draw it. But if I read a book, that means I’ve got the \ndescription in my head and I would know how to draw it. ...The thing \nthat helps me do art is my reading. You see how one author describes a \nperson, and how another one would, then you can compare, take half of \none or half of another, and draw it yourself and it’ll look weird.  \n(Joseph, Year 5) \n \nA fourth group of children in School J made small-scale models of chairs. This \ncould have been a pure Design and Technology task. However, as they were \nplanning their teacher said they could imagine these chairs for a particular \ncharacter in a story. With this prompt the work came to life: \n \nWe had to think of a character that we wanted the chair for. We did an \nAlien chair, a Mermaid chair, a Harry Potter chair, a Baba Yaga Bony \nLegs chair – that one has chicken legs - a Giraffe chair – that one had a \nlong back, for the long neck - , Goldilocks, James and the Giant Peach. \nWe had to do things that matched the person [character]... An ordinary \nchair would be boring. Because you know the character, it’s easy to \nknow what to make it [the chair] like. You know what it’s for. Even if \nit’s a made-up chair. (Daniella, Year 6)    \n \nChildren used their knowledge of stories for this Design and Technology work, \nto design and make a chair in their chosen story-world. It was interesting that \nthese children, like those who worked from the two novels, also recalled the \nsequencing and techniques of this work in great detail. It was teacher \nknowledge and intervention that ‘lifted’ this activity, made it memorable and \nconnected it to other learning for children. \n \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n157 \nChildren’s stories, literature and poetry were powerful paths forward in \ncreative projects, even where reading was not fully developed. Where children \nhad a story, a poem or a book ‘in their head’ they knew what this imaginary \nworld looked like. They had ideas of what they would do in, or make for, or \nwrite about this imagined world. They could enter and enact, move, dance, \ncreate artwork and writing in the imaginary world that develops between the \nreader and the text.   \n \nInvented worlds \nIn all of these examples, children’s interests and skills in art, design and \ntechnology are supported by drawing, crafting and model-making. But making, \ncrafting and modelling are also opportunities for children to represent real and \nimagined worlds; work in the creative arts offers children access to ‘third \nspaces’, or ‘secondary worlds’. Children’s work and evaluations in this chapter \nare evidence of their awareness of this heightened reality.   \n \nKate Pahl (1999) describes how young children enter a ‘third dimension’ \nthrough model-making and crafting, and how children use their bodies and \nspace to play and enact stories with their models. They become ‘larger and \nmore powerful’. Through their play and enactment, children become ‘larger \nand more powerful’, and play becomes ‘more real’. Children use symbolic \nstructures to express thoughts and emotions which transcend the external \ncontent of their models.   \n \nPahl writes that ‘literacy activities can be experienced as three-dimensional’. \nModel-making is children’s response to narrative, a way for children to continue \nstories they heard or stories in familiar texts. Their models are reflections of \nstories they enjoyed.  Children use their models in play and in many other \nactivities, including literacy activities. Modelling and crafting stimulate \nchildren’s talk, and that talk can become writing. In the examples in this \nchapter, children’s work in creative arts enabled them to make and share their \nown secondary, imaginary worlds.   \n \nMichael Benton (1992) also describes this imaginary world as ‘the limbo \nbetween the author and the reader. Benton discusses how literature and the \ncreative arts both create imaginary, ‘secondary’ worlds that respond to and try \nto make sense of the real, ‘primary’ world. Through reading and through work \nin the creative arts, children can enter and interpret these worlds. Benton \nquotes an 8-year old girl who said that when she reads a book:  \n \nI sort of feel like I’m invisible and walking around unseen with the things \nor people in the book. \n \nIn the projects presented here, young readers enter imaginary worlds and, \nthrough work in the creative arts, represent these worlds in drawings, models, \nenactment, talk and writing. Children were able to manifest stories and \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n158 \nliterature in three-dimensional forms and these were powerful literacy and \nartistic experiences. We observed ‘three-dimensional literacy’ in creative arts \nprojects, where children moved between the world of the story and their \nphysical or visual manifestations of the storyworld. This process deepened their \nunderstanding of the story and of the artistic process. As Michael Benton (ibid.) \nnotes: reading, writing and the creative arts ‘entail abstraction and filling in’, \nthey are ‘anticipatory yet retrospective.’  Children demonstrated how capable \nthey are of this type of sophisticated work and response.       \n \n \n \n \n \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n159 \n \n \n \n \n             Chapter 8 \n \n \n  Children’s reflections and self-evaluations \n \n \nWhen you’re working with a teacher, you feel you are trying your best. It’s \njust normal. When an artist comes, you know he is very good at something. \nSo for me, you have to push yourself upwards to be good enough to let him \nteach you. You can’t keep talking and waste time. I feel I have to push \nmyself upwards to be a good enough standard to let him teach me. (Vivien, \nYear 6) \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n160 \n \nYou can never get it wrong \nChildren we interviewed were articulate about the many ways in which they \nfelt working in creative arts projects made a wide impact on their learning. In \ninterviews, children said they felt they could ‘never go wrong’ and ‘never get it \nwrong’ whilst working with professional ‘arts partners’ in the classroom. \n \nThe emphasis on doing, making and crafting (practicum) in creative arts \nprojects was a welcome way of working for many children. Children said they \nenjoyed ‘getting on with things’ and that this way of working gave them more \nconfidence in a range of other work in school. They also felt that arts partners \ngave them more responsibility and respect than teachers.  \n \n Dance is fun and you can’t get it wrong. (Cassie, Year 2) \n \nIt was different for us to just get on with things...I learned how to use \nthe computer a bit more, and how to set your imagination free. It \nhelped my writing by boosting up my confidence because I didn’t used \nto write a lot, but now I write quite a bit more than I used to, because I \nhave more ideas.(Gordon, Year 5) \n \n(CLPE: how is [arts partner] different to your teacher? \nTashi, Year 5: He shows, he takes really quickly to show us how to do it, \nhe’s quick – da-da-da-da- -- and that’s really good, that’s how you do it, \nand we actually get on with it, and we do it. [Teacher] takes, she likes \ntelling everybody perfectly how to do it and if even one person doesn’t \nunderstand she tells the whole procedure again. With [arts partner] we \njust got on with it... he said, the thing I liked about him, he says – ‘it \ndoesn’t matter what you do because you can never get this wrong’.  \n \nThey trusted us. They showed us ONCE how to do something and then \nleft us to go help some one else. Teachers – they don’t ever leave you! \n‘Cos they’re never sure if we can do it.(Sorcha, Year 6) \n \n \nChildren reported feeling more confident in their ability to communicate with \npeers and with teachers as a result of work in creative arts projects. Children \nfelt that creative arts projects also improved class relationships.       \n \n \n[Arts partner]  J plays games and tells stories. She teaches us what we \ndon’t really know. When I first did stories I was shy and nervous of the \nchildren and the teacher.(Bobby, Year 2) \n \n \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n161 \nOur class is split up now. When I see the model I remember the good time \nwe had making it. The group work was good, we all got to do it. You see \nit and think, we did that?! You don’t think it’s going to turn out good, \nand it turns out good!(Sophie, Year 6) \n  \n We used to bully each other, but we know each other much better now. \n(Grace, Year 5) \n \nDoing and knowing \nIn creative projects there was a live connection for children between doing and \nknowing. Creative projects were memorable for what children were learning \nand how they were learning.  \n \nEven the very youngest children recalled in detail their work in creative \nprojects. In this observation Nursery children returned to the studio after a gap \nof one week to un-peel plaster casts they had made of their hands: \n \n(CLPE) What’s in there? [a paper cup full of hard plaster] \n \n(Tia, age 3) My hand. \n \n(CLPE) How do you know your hand is in there? Is it really your hand? \n \n(Tia) This [indicates] is my real hand. In there [the cup] is my other hand. \n(her teacher starts to un-peel it) My thumb! My ankle! (Tia looks at her \nown hand and compares it with the plaster hand). It’s heavy, and smooth. \nIt’s hard. \n \n(CLPE) How did you make it? \n \n(Tia) We dipped our hand in the plaster. It was soft then. It was...wet. \ncold. Soft. sticky. We had to keep it in there, keep the hand very still. \nThen we took it out. Now it’s all hard.  \n \n In interviews with older children, creative projects seemed to generate a lot \nof indirect learning. Children attributed their improvements in reading and \nwriting to work with the creative arts partner – even though the arts partner \nhad never explicitly taught these things. \n \nIt was a proper, proper film like a video, like in Hollywood...I’ve never \ndone anything like that, properly. [It] has helped me with \nunderstanding. I’ve learned new words cos we did quite a lot of reading. \nI’m better at my reading. I’m better at everything actually. (Kiah, Year \n5)       \n \n \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n162 \nApprenticeship \nWhen children learned skills they also learned related language to these skills. \nThis naming of techniques and media helped them feel proficient and \nprofessional in project work and enabled them to apply their learning to new \ncontexts in school. Children said they ‘knew what to do’ in creative projects \nbecause they had been able to practice and rehearse.  \n \nIn conversations, children recalled this process vividly. Dami, Vivien and \nJasmine in Year 5 describe their memories of working with their arts partner \nnearly a year earlier: \n \nDami: Step by step she told us what to do. In the beginning she told us \nwhat to do. I think she knew that children don’t remember stuff that \nwell. \n \nVivien: She gave us the time.  \n \nDami: She was an artist. She told us what she does and what she was \ngoing to teach us.  \n \nCLPE: What did she teach you? \n \nDami: The modelling.  \n \nVivien: How to make newspaper roll-up muscles, and how to bend wires.  \n \nDami: And she taught us new words, words we are not familiar with that \nhad to do with muscles. Long words. Contour. Anatomy. Tension. Tendon. \nArmature.  \n \nVivien: We had to mix colours. It was hard to get the exact right colour \nfor the skin. \n \nDami: We had special paper to try it out, because if you just go and put it \non the model, that’s the end of it, you can’t take it off. \n \nDami: Maybe when we go to secondary school we might come across those \nbig words because in primary school you don’t really learn big words like \nthat.      \n \nVivien: It might help us when we write about art, we can use these \nwords. It was fun, and hard. \n \n \n \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n163 \nJasmine: We couldn’t go wrong with her directions, the way she \nexplained it. It was hard but surprising. You think it won’t be good, and it \nturns out good! We could even show our new teacher how to do it because \nshe didn’t know.  \n \nChildren said they learned ‘real things’ that made them appreciate the nuts \nand bolts of real-world culture. Arts partners gave a clear message to children \nthat nothing comes without hard work and practice. Working with professionals \ngave children a sense of high standards.  \n \nWe practiced. Every Thursday [arts partner] N would come down…We just \npracticed a lot and we got used to it. If you rehearse again and again you \nget better. And it turned out good.  (Kiah, Year 5)   \n \nMy stories wouldn’t be better if [arts partner] J didn’t come... I get help \nfrom her because she is a storyteller and she’s for everybody in the \nclass......She says everyone in the class is getting better. (Nura, Year 2) \n \nI have to say, I have to be true, it was quite fun but she [arts partner RB] \nwas quite strict… But you couldn’t really think about her being strict, you \nhad to leave that alone. You had to concentrate on what you were \ndoing…She wanted all of us to be high-standard. She wanted us to be \nreally good. She was forcing us – actually forcing us – to go high. Even if \nyou were in the middle she would force you to go high. (Dami, Year 6) \n \nWorld-making \nIn interviews, children repeatedly spoke of ideas ‘coming into’ their heads \nwhen they worked in creative projects. Children described creative work as a \nkind of ‘day-dreaming’, making mental concepts and images visible in artwork, \nwords, play and bodily enactment.  \n \nWhen I write then I’m talking in my head, I’m looking at my work, I’m day \ndreaming and then I write again…I take lots of ideas from movies I see. \nMaking a story is like pictures in a movie. When I write I think about \ndifferent pictures from a movie, that helps me to write a story.(Tunde, \nYear 5) \n  \nIt kind-of helped us [with writing], because we done the dance and we \nstill got ideas in our head. It was the next day that we writed a bit. The \ndance did help us a lot. We had to remember. The dance helped us sort-\nof, well, remember. (WIlf, Year 2) \n \n[In dance] instead of seeing it [mimes reading with eyeglasses], we were \nseeing it in our heads, not acting it. We were seeing it in our heads...I did \nsee pictures in my head, when I was dancing. I imagined it. Shall I just \nshow you? I imagined it like this [he makes a box-shape with his body on \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n164 \nthe floor]...It was more imaginative, thinking how you would do it. That’s \nwhy I like dance. [Arts partner] G taught us: do not be shy, to dance, and \nhow to be a sort of crab and a sort of snake. (Cal, Year 2) \n \nIn interviews, children expressed a growing awareness of how their minds \nworked in creative modes. They were able to articulate why they enjoyed \nworking in the creative arts. They were also beginning to evaluate their skills \nand progress. \n \nOnce I was drawing the pictures, I started going into a different world \nand making up all different stories myself. Even though I didn’t know the \nstories, I got my ideas together.. Me and my friends imagined and we kind \nof went crazy. I really can’t help it, whenever I see something I just start \nday-dreaming and thinking – every time I make a work. (Tashi, Year 5) \n \nI love drawing. I feel like I’m going to another world. When you draw, you \ncan remember the things you’ve drawn. You can get into it. Artists like \nRB really get into it. They draw details, not only a simple drawing. \n(Vivien, Year 6) \n \nHouses I can draw, but not like a house you see here. I draw pretend \nhouses, not normal houses. I might be better now. (Dami, Year 6)   \n \nChildren would often internalise the ‘voice’ of their arts partners. They \nrecalled what arts partners told them about how to observe and how to work.  \n \nWith [arts partner] RB you couldn’t go wrong. Even if you did something \nwrong, she would say, oh you can do this or this with it, you can fix it so \nit’s not a mistake anymore. I’m more confident with art now. Now I know \nwhat to do. In class now when we went to the woodland to sketch \nsquirrels, I was thinking about what RB told me about looking and \ndrawing what you see. What I remember RB saying is, ‘Look, \nconcentrate’. (Louisa, Year 6 was in Year 5 in the arts project) \n \nArts partners often conveyed to children a strong sense of audience and \npurpose for their work.  \n \n[When I work now] I kind of half-think of [arts partner] T’s ideas and \nwhat he says. I kind of picture him in my head and remember the good \nway to draw....[The purpose of the project]  I think it was for T to take \naway and give to the people he was doing it for. It made me do it a lot \nbetter to know it was going to go somewhere where they had to look \ncarefully and they would see it and look at it and do stuff with it. I \ntried to make it the best thing I’ve ever done.  ...[When I work now] I \ntry to imagine that T is gonna give it to somebody. It gives me – what’s \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n165 \nthe word? – it gives me better writing. It begins with E – it enfluences \nme. (Tashi, Year 5) \n \nIf we did it another time, we would all get on with it. We should be \nable to do it again and improve.  For me, it makes me feel that our \nschool is really special for an artist to come and be able to work with us \nand be able to teach us new things. It makes us feel special. That’s how \nI feel. (Dami, Year 6) \n \n \nCreativity in a context of making and imagining.  \nThese self-reports show children responding and expanding in situations where \ntheir own creativity is being called on by artist partners who are at home with \ncreative ways of working. In these contexts, children begin to access their own \npowers of imagination and inhabit their own imagined mental worlds. These \nexperiences of exercising their own creativity, within a context of imagining \nand making, often give them confidence in other contexts, and they feel \nchanged. \n \nThere is sometimes a sense of being galvanised and released about these \naccounts (‘Once I was drawing the pictures, I started going into a different \nworld and making up all different stories myself... Me and my friends \nimagined and we kind of went crazy’). Children are freed up, in particular, by \nthe sense that ‘it doesn’t matter what you do because you can never get this \nwrong’. This freedom from a preoccupation with the possibility of error enables \nthem to venture and to experiment.  \n \nChildren become more aware of how their minds work in this creative mode. \nSometimes they experience their own creative imagining as a kind of eidetic \nimagery on an inner screen (‘Making a story is like pictures in a movie’, \n‘Instead of seeing it, we were seeing it in our heads’). Sometimes they are \nconscious of an inner monologue that accompanies their writing (‘When I write \nthen I’m talking in my head…’). Sometimes, in relation to dance and \nenactment in particular, their imagining is bodily imagining, experienced \nthrough kinetic imagery (‘I imagined it like this’ [he makes a box-shape with \nhis body on the floor]). These self-reports show children becoming more \nconfident about their own artistic abilities and learning how to tap into their \ncreative processes. \n \nThe evidence from these self-evaluations shows how important artistic \nexperiences can be in the awakening and development of children’s creative \nthinking. Artistic routes into creative modes of thought are concrete, they \ninvolve enactment through the body, play, and the use of symbolic languages \n(like drawing) that complement and support each other, and enable ideas to be \nrealised through representation. They involve children in ‘daydreaming’ and \nstorying in ways that resemble their own imaginative play.  \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n166 \n \nIn interviews, children would describe two distinct qualities of their learning \nexperiences in creative partnerships. They were aware of their improvements \nin skills (‘I might be better now’), and they were also aware of how they felt \nand thought in these contexts (‘I did see pictures in my head’. ‘It makes us feel \nspecial’). Children’s evaluations of their work and experiences always had a \nstrong affective dimension. Artistic ways of working take account of affective \nlearning. They are not - like the subjects of the primary curriculum - \ncompletely focused on the cognitive. They often result in an artistic product \nwhich can surprise its makers: \n \n‘ When I see the model I remember the good time we had making it. The \ngroup work was good, we all got to do it. You see it and think, we did \nthat?! You don’t think it’s going to turn out good, and it turns out \ngood!’ \n \nCreative arts projects engaged children at an emotional as well as a cognitive \nlevel; they developed children’s abilities by involving them in work to which \nthey developed a deep personal commitment.  \n \nCreative communities \nWithin some of these classrooms, though not all, artist partners and teachers \nworking with children established, at least for a time, creative communities in \nwhich everybody was involved in the creative work. Children often experienced \nlearning in the arts sessions as powerfully different from other school learning, \nbecause they felt trusted and ‘left to get on with things’. They felt as if they \nwere treated differently by artist partners, as people rather than pupils. As \nJahura (Class Study Four) said, ‘I felt like a proper person’. Children learned by \nwatching and imitating, trial and error. They took on demanding roles and were \nsometimes surprised by their own abilities to fulfil them. They learned to share \nand collaborate and work together as a creative team.  \n \nThese successful communities were marked by two apparently opposite \ntendencies. On the one hand there was a relaxed, easy and informal mood in \nmany creative project sessions, and a general sense that ‘you couldn’t go \nwrong’; error was part of learning and practising, and there was time to carry \nprojects through and finish them. On the other hand there was a focused and \nprofessional workshop atmosphere in which expectations and standards were \nhigh. Children were inducted into particular art forms, into related skills and \ntechniques, and into specialised vocabularies. They did not resent the fact that \nartist partners were often making difficult demands of them, instead they \nappreciated the trust that was being placed in their ability to match up with \nexpectations. They reached up to meet the standards they felt were expected \nof them, sometimes surprising themselves in the process: \n  \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n167 \n‘She wanted all of us to be high-standard. She wanted us to be really \ngood. She was forcing us – actually forcing us – to go high. Even if you \nwere in the middle she would force you to go high.’  \n \n ‘...I’ve never done anything like that, properly’ \n \n‘When an artist comes, you know he is very good at something. So for me, \nyou have to push yourself upwards to be good enough to let him teach \nyou.’ \n \nThere was a craft-apprentice model in this way of working which suited many \nchildren. They understood and accepted the fact that getting better in a \nparticular art form involves frequent practice. They felt capable and \nappreciated, they enjoyed what they were doing even when finding it quite \ndifficult (‘It was fun and hard.’) They appreciated the possibilities of \ndeveloping their own ideas within a supportive context. They respected the \nprofessionalism of the artists they were working with. The fact that these \nchances to work alongside professional artist-craftsmen were unusual and one-\noff experiences, probably enhanced children’s sense of the specialness of these \nopportunities. \n \nChildren’s inexperience in practicum \nTeachers and arts partners expressed shock and dismay at many children’s lack \nof skill in basic craft techniques such as cutting and sticking. It was observable \nthat many children are inexperienced in, as one arts partner described it, “the \nrhythm of making things”. Those who were experienced at drawing or \nmodelling inevitably did this at home regularly with parents or siblings.  \n \n[At home] I like drawing. I do write on the computer and search around \non the computer. If I had that stuff what [arts partner] T helped us \nwith, at home, I would do a story but with a different plot.  [At home \ndrawing and writing] It’s different cos you ain’t got teachers or \nassistants always helping you or always telling you how to do it. Mum \nand Dad just let you get on with it.  (Jordan, Year 4)  \n \n[At home} I make model castles from boxes, and I draw cars that go by, \nor cars that are in the street, I do a lot of drawing with my parents and \nmy brother.... The last time I did this kind of [3-D sculpture] modelling \n[in school] was in Year 2.(Joseph, Year 5) \n \nWe do collages at home. We do drawings. Our little sisters make houses \nout of boxes but we don’t do that no more...[In school} we hadn’t done \njunk modelling for a long time. Like those models up there [points] in \nReception. We hadn’t done it for a long time, so we were confused.  \n(Louise and Daniella, Year 6) \n \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n168 \nThe work they [Year 5] did was no better than Reception cutting and \nsticking. They were like kids in a candy shop, they went wild with the \nmaterials. It is no one’s fault but the curriculum. \n (Year 5 Teacher JA) \n \nSo many of them hold the scissors upside down or the wrong way and \nthis makes them discouraged. They say, “I can’t do it!” (Arts partner ML \non a mixed Year 5/6 class) \n \nChildren who learned techniques and skills with arts partners said they feel \nmore confident to attempt other design and art work in class.  \n \nWe’re doing things like chairs and tables and sofas now for our 1930s \nhouses. You know how you fix things together? We’re doing lots of fixing \nthings. Like now we know how to make furniture stand up off the floor. \n(Louise and Daniella, Year 6)  \n \nHowever children did not always have such opportunities to practice or extend \ntheir new skills. In interviews at School GM, Year 5 children said they wanted to \ncreate sculptures about their current class novel The Iron Man using the 3-D \nmodelling techniques they learned with the arts partner in the previous year. \nInstead, they made charcoal drawings of this character. Year 4 children \nsimilarly said they wanted to create a large sculpture based on their current \nclass text, The Ugly Duckling, using techniques they learned in the previous \nyear with their arts partner.       \n \nTeachers and arts partners did not always take children’s inexperience into \nconsideration when planning.  Two partnerships realised that children needed \nextended time to play and practice with materials and techniques before \nattempting to make a piece of artwork.  \n \nChildren’s inexperience in making and crafting was symptomatic of their \ninexperience in other ‘atelier’ ways of working. Children were also observed to \nbe inexperienced in practices that involved drama, role play, movement, \ndiscussion, negotiation, experimenting, visualising and drawing. It took time to \ninduct children into these ways of working. Arts partner GA said it took six \nweeks for children to feel comfortable working in a different way to their \nclassroom routines.    \n \nIn the projects we observed for this research, children rarely moved beyond \n‘induction’ into creative practices. Even where projects ran for three terms, \nchildren went on to new teachers in new classes, or to new schools, and did not \ncontinue or progress in filmmaking, dance, drama, sculpture or storytelling.  \n \n \n \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n169 \nMatt \nMatt was four years old when he attended Nursery School C. For three terms he \nhad lengthy (up to two hours) sessions working in an art studio with his \nteachers and with professional artists. In Animating Literacy, his teachers \ntracked Matt’s development in a range of artwork and how his language and \ncommunication developed through his drawing and making. When Matt went on \nto primary school, Nursery Teacher AB contacted his new teacher to find out \nwhether he continued to develop in artwork and communication.  \n \nNursery Teacher AB: Does Matt appear confident when participating in \nartwork? \n \nPrimary School teacher CM: Yes. He likes to talk about his work with \nothers and also ask others questions about their work. \n \nAB: Have you noticed anything interesting or unusual about Matt’s art \nwork? \n \nCM: No not really. \n \nAB: Do you think he communicates through his drawings? \n \nCM: No more than any other child.  \n \nMatt’s prior artistic and language experiences did not appear to count for much \nin his new primary school. He seemed to be starting from the beginning in a \nnew context.  \n \nLincoln \nLincoln was ten years old when he was in Year 5 at School A. For three terms \nhe worked in drama and filmmaking with arts partner NB. At the end of the \nschool year, a letter from his mother testified to what he had learned in the \ncreative arts project  \n \nFor my son, his attitude towards literacy has changed from a negative one \nto a positive one. He came home and related tales of his literacy classes \nwith an enthusiasm that I’d never witnesses before. It really turned \nthings around for him…He felt he was treated as a mature student and \nallowed to follow through on his own ideas with guidance from the \nadults. This was a key factor in helping to create a positive experience \nfor him. Thank you for showing this faith and trust in his abilities. I felt \nthe project was able to deliver a message to the students that learning \ncan be fun. What a legacy. \n \nHe particularly enjoyed having an acting part in the films but also found \nbeing a member of the film crew a pleasurable experience. I heard that \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n170 \nhe was described as a ‘natural’ with a camera. We would like to get him a \ncamera for his birthday to allow him to pursue his new hobby in \nphotography. (Mrs. K.B.) \n \nAt the end of the school year, this filmmaking and indeed all creative arts \nprojects at School A were abandoned. The school was in the lowest band of \nattainment in the local education authority. There was considerable pressure \non this school to devote all resources into raising children’s attainment. A new \nheadteacher intended to focus on improving academic achievement and raising \ntest scores. Lincoln would have to develop his interest in filmmaking \nelsewhere. However it was the creative arts project that motivated Lincoln to \nget involved in school work. His own mother observed his changed attitude (‘It \nreally turned things around for him’). \n \nIt seems as though children may continually be re-inducted into creative arts \npractices, processes and apprenticeships in school.  There is no long-term \nstrategy about their learning and development in the creative arts. Yet, as \nteachers and arts partners observed, other areas of learning were strongly \ninfluenced by children’s work in creative arts projects.  Children themselves in \nthis chapter have testified to their thinking, awareness and learning as they \nwork in the creative arts.    \n \nBeing creative in school \nCurrent policy discussions of creativity tend to downplay the role of the arts in \nchildren’s creative development, as if there were something déjà vu about \ndiscussions of creativity in this context, or as if a focus on the arts (as low \nstatus subjects in schools) might weaken the case for ‘teaching for creativity’. \nThe QCA ‘creativity framework’, for instance, is closely focused on teaching \nthinking, on questioning, brainstorming, and critical thinking. It deals in mental \nprocesses and abstract learning. It takes much less account of creative \nactivities which are rooted in making, picturing and pretending.  \nThe QCA (2003) model of creativity emphasises skills in divergent thinking, \nwhere children can see connections between apparently disparate things, \nbrainstorm ideas and solve problems.  In this paradigm, the creative arts hold \nno special place in creativity. QCA examples in How to Spot Creativity offer \nexemplar lessons in Science, Maths, PE, Music, and Design Technology. QCA \nstates that  \nCreative pupils are curious, question and challenge, and don't always \nfollow rules. They: \n• ask 'why?' 'how?' 'what if?'  \n• ask unusual questions  \n• respond to ideas, questions, tasks or problems in a surprising way  \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n171 \n• challenge conventions and their own and others' assumptions  \n• think independently  \n(QCA, Creativity, Find It, Promote It!) \n \nQCA goes on to state that ‘pupils can't be expected to think and behave \ncreatively in every single lesson’ and that teachers can promote creativity ‘by \nmaking only minor adjustments to their lesson plans’.  But Ellen Winner \n(1982), in her study of the psychology of the arts, says the links between \nbrainstorming, divergent thinking and creativity may be tenuous.  \n \nPerhaps a clear relationship has not been established between divergent \nthinking and creativity… because of the fact that the types of tasks used \nto measure divergent thinking are a far cry from the nature of creative \nendeavour. The ability to rattle off fifteen unusual uses for a brick, or \ntwenty-five words beginning with b, suggests a mind that is clever, quick \nand flexible, but not necessarily capable of the kind of deep thought \nwhich is generally associated with creativity in the arts or sciences. \n(Winner 1982) \n \nOur observations appear to confirm this. What we saw in classrooms was not \nthe QCA model of divergent thinking but something deeper, more meditative \nand reflective. Observations of children at work in creative arts projects - and \nchildren’s own evaluations – revealed a combination of inward contemplation \nand outward action that was rare in other curriculum tasks. In effective \ncreative arts projects there was always ‘Interaction of Hand and Mind’ (APU \nop.cit.) and thought in action, where children mediated their thinking and \ntheir language in the acts of imagining, doing and making.    \n \nSelf evaluation and assessment \nChildren’s self-evaluations in this chapter, of the ways in which they were \nchanged by the opportunity to work with artists and practitioners, give a \npowerful insight into how well they understand their own learning. They also \ndemonstrate how explicit young children can be about the kind of learning \ncontexts that work best for them. The quality of the observations is striking, \nchildren find language to describe what was happening to them and what was \nspecial about these experiences. The opportunity to look back and reflect on \ntheir own learning was something that most of them appreciated, their \nresponses were detailed and honest. In any assessment of these projects, and \nof the learning that went on within them, children’s self-evaluations deserve to \nbe given a central place. \n \nWork in the creative arts provided children with symbolic languages for \nrepresenting thought. Children’s hypothesising was rooted in pretending, and \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n172 \ntheir verbal thought was rooted in other than verbal symbols, in visual or in \nkinetic imagery. As children took on artistic languages in creative arts projects, \nthey were also taking on the means of representing ideas and feelings. \nChildren’s responses in this chapter show how important and rewarding these \nlearning experiences were for them. \n \nChildren saw connections between their work in creative arts projects and their \nliteracy work, and they understood the importance of narrative or story in both \nof these processes. Work in a creative arts project heightened literacy \nlearning, making the experience concrete, physical and multimodal.    \n \nWriting a story is just like a film because you have to write the story \nbefore you can film, so it’s kind of just the same, except you’re acting it \nout, you have to do action.  (Kiah, Year 5)  \n \nThe routes into creative thinking established in these projects could be \ndeveloped in other curriculum areas. Creative thinking can be as valuable in \nscience as in the arts. But for this to happen, the active, concrete and \nimaginative modes of learning evident here would need to be recognised as \nvalid in other areas of the curriculum. Children’s responses in this chapter have \nmade clear how opportunities to learn through doing and making and \npractising, and through playing, storying and imagining, continue to be \nimportant throughout the primary school.  \n \n  \n \n \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n173 \n \n \n \n          Chapter 9 \n \n  Issues in assessment and progression \n \n \n \n \nThe children could have got a lot more out of the [filmmaking] project. \nThere was a lot of motivation to write, there was a lot of interest in \nthese story ideas, but then it was the end of the day. It was lost in the \nfollow-up. When I saw their levels of literacy, I felt they were quite low. \nThere is loads of potential but it is very hard to measure. There is long-\nterm work here in terms of their literacy, in terms of the work with each \nother, on lots of different levels.  \n(Arts partner NB)  \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n174 \n \nProblems of assessing creative projects \nAll teachers and arts partners carried out some form of ‘closure’ activity at the \nend of creative arts projects. Sometimes this was in the form of a performance \nor exhibition. In other classrooms children were encouraged to evaluate \nprojects informally by describing how they felt about them. In one class \nchildren made mind-maps to demonstrate their understanding of the sequence \nand relationship of project elements. Such evaluations focused on children’s \nself-assessment of learning and feelings rather than critical appraisals of final \nproducts or performances. Schools celebrated the occasions and opportunities \nof creative arts partnerships with exhibitions, performances and community \nevenings.  \n \nFor the most part, there were no problems in the work of creative arts \nprojects. Teachers and children enjoyed their experiences. However issues \narose for teachers over whether, and how, to assess this work.  Because \ncreative arts projects crossed curriculum boundaries teachers were sometimes \nunsure where to locate children’s learning: was dancing to music and a \nBenjamin Zephaniah poem recorded in Patois work in PE, music, PSE or \nliteracy? Was enactment of a novel set in Bangladesh work in geography, PSE, \ndrama or literacy? Was a documentary film work in History or English?  \n \nIn project classrooms and in schools there was some unease at the idea of \nassessing children’s creative work and dissatisfaction with available models of \nassessment to do so. Some headteachers frankly thought it was unnecessary to \nassess children’s work in creative arts projects.   \n \nWe don’t have to persuade parents of the importance of the arts. Parents \nare not saying, ‘I’m worried that my child isn’t doing enough of the \nbasics, they’re doing too much art’.  They can see in the children’s work \ntheir achievement in ‘the basics’, particularly the fantastic writing. And \nthey know how inspired their children are because they talk about the \nwork at home. (Headteacher PB) \n \nI get irritated! Why should we have to prove that the arts work and make \na difference? I feel that there will never be ‘hard’ evidence, only \nanecdotal evidence. I feel the main impact is on children’s motivation \nand engagement. And also on their speaking and listening, when they \nhave something in front of them it inspires them to talk. I do know that I \nhave hard evidence linking the arts to school attendance. Since we’ve had \narts activities every Friday, attendance is up on Fridays. Before we \nstarted the arts activities attendance always went down on a Friday. \n(Headteacher SA) \n \n \n \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n175 \nThere was a general feeling that children’s work in creative arts projects could \nbe characterised but not measured, that this work was distinct from the \ncurriculum. Creative arts projects were viewed as opportunities for something \nexciting and different to happen, even where this was only a one-off \nexperience.  \n \nI’ve seen literacy come to life in these creative arts projects, not just \n‘Animating Literacy’ but animating children!...Parents of children who \nwere at the point of being turned-off have come in and said to me, ‘My \nchild can read, my child can write’. (Headteacher SW) \n \nFor the most part, work in creative arts projects seemed to exist in a parallel \nuniverse to statutory curriculum and assessment frameworks.  Teachers who \nwanted to evaluate children’s work in creative arts projects separately \ntherefore had a double-work load. \n \nAssessing literacy outcomes from creative arts projects  \nBy its very title, and by emphasising the potential gains for children’s literacy \nthat might result from their involvement in creative arts work, the Animating \nLiteracy action research project raised expectations among teachers. With this \nin mind, several project teachers set out to map children’s progress in literacy \nin relation to children’s arts experiences.  \n \nNursery teachers at School C showed children’s progression along two parallel \ntracks: the Stepping Stones for Language and Literacy and for Creativity of the \nFoundation Stage Early Learning Goals. Children worked alongside artists in the \nNursery and in a studio outside of school. The teachers tracked children’s \ndevelopment in a range of artwork. They also analysed both how children’s \nlanguage developed through their artwork and how they communicated through \ntheir artwork. \n \nWe are not able to determine whether they have progressed purely \nbecause of the project or has this been a natural development? We would \nlike to think that it is a combination of both and that the children are \nconfident artists who are aware that adults value their work and that \nthey will continue to develop their literacy and creative skills \nconcurrently. (Nursery teachers AB and BL)  \n \nTwo teachers used non-statutory assessment frameworks to show improvements \nin children’s writing as well as their attitudes to and participation in literacy \nwork after creative arts projects.  Teacher AH was interested in children’s \nattitudes to literacy which he was able to evaluate at different points in the \nproject with a simple framework (Appendix 2a). Like Teacher GD, he found \nCLPE Reading and Writing Scales (Appendix 2) a useful measure of children’s \nprogress: \n \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n176 \nRather than a purely numerical score, the Scales focus on how children \nmove from inexperience to experience. It was this word experience which \nseemed so important and useful when trying to find ways of helping \nchildren to make progress. (Year 6 teacher AH)     \n \nTwo teachers also showed children’s marked gains in Key Stage optional and \nstatutory tests (Appendix 3), and attributed these to developments in \nchildren’s literacy occasioned by their work in creative arts projects.  \n \nThe two focus children, Nura and Blessing, moved from achieving below \nLevel 2c at the start of Year 2, to 2a and 2b respectively in their \nstatutory SATs tests. For Nura who only recently learned to speak \nEnglish, and for Blessing who was at risk of becoming seriously \ndisaffected, these were exciting results. More importantly, however, \nstory telling changed their view of themselves. Both Blessing and Nura \nwill confidently tell stories in class.  Blessing says that before [arts \npartner] JB came, she could not read or write but now she can do both.  \nThe whole class benefited from this work, but particularly children who \nhave English an Additional Language. (Year 2 teacher AO) \n \nThree teachers who also showed gains in statutory tests were unsure how these \nwere related to children’s work in the creative arts project.  \n \nTo answer our initial question, is dance an effective way of supporting \nthe writing skills for Key Stage 1 children? Our answer is no. It is \nimpossible to collect numerical data to support an answer. We can not \nseparate the development and academic achievement of children into \ndefined categories. We can not attribute achievement or progress to one \nthing. (Year 2 teachers SP, CM and AR) \n \nTeachers felt it was difficult to assess gains in the big shapes of literacy that \nemerged from work in creative arts projects. Whereas the ‘small’ shapes of \nliteracy (spelling, punctuation, handwriting) were relatively straightforward to \nassess, teachers were unsure how to assess the marked improvements they \nobserved in children’s attitudes to literacy work and their speaking and \nlistening. They were also at a loss over how to make count, in terms of \nstatutory assessment, improvements in children’s collaborative work, and in \nwhat Dorothy Heathcote has termed the ‘social health of the class’.   \n \nThe National Curriculum: Speaking, Listening and Drama  \nIn general teachers did not use the National Curriculum’s Speaking and \nListening attainment targets, a statutory strand of the Programme of Study for \nEnglish, to show progress in children’s language within creative arts projects. \nOnly one teacher (AH) made the development of spoken language, and \nespecially children’s ability to ask relevant and thoughtful questions, the focus \nof his investigation of their language and literacy progress. But the National \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n177 \nCurriculum framework for teacher assessment in Speaking and Listening did not \nseem to be being used extensively in participating schools. Most teachers \nreadily acknowledged the key role of speaking and listening in children’s \nlearning. But speaking and listening is measured only by teacher assessment. \nThe two other strands of the English curriculum – Reading and Writing – are \nboth teacher-assessed and assessed by written examinations that are marked \nexternally and moderated at the end of Key Stage 2.  Attainment scores for \nReading and Writing (but not Speaking and Listening) are published in national \n‘league tables’ of school achievement. This in itself gives Speaking and \nListening lower status in the statutory assessment framework. Because project \nteachers knew speaking and listening ‘counts’ for less compared with \nassessment through the SATs, there was far less focus on progress in speaking \nand listening than on progress in writing.  \n \nThe attainment target for Speaking and Listening is a part of the assessment of \nthe English Curriculum, rather than any broader cross-curricular language \ndevelopment. It is focused on the development of forms of talk. Although the \nattainment target draws attention to children’s ability to work positively and \nflexibly in groups, group discussion is rarely envisaged (with rare exceptions) in \nany other context than the English classroom and is seen as a matter of \nlearning how to use formal group procedures.  \n \nAt Key Stage 2 children have six areas of attainment: speaking, listening, group \ndiscussions and interactions, drama, standard English and language variation. \nWith the notable exception of drama, none of the attainment targets refer to \nchildren in any creative art activity. Overwhelmingly, progress in speaking and \nlistening is seen as the ability to adapt communication for increasingly public \nand formal audiences and to use appropriate language, including standard \nEnglish.  \n \nIn Group Discussion and Interaction: to use different ways to help the \ngroup move forward, including summarising the main points, reviewing \nwhat has been said, clarifying, drawing others in, reaching agreement, \nconsidering alternatives and anticipating consequences. \n \nIn Listening: to recall and re-present important features of an argument, \ntalk, reading, radio or tv programme, film. \n \nIn Speaking: to gain and maintain the interest and response of different \naudiences.  \n \nBecause of this, the Speaking and Listening AT would not have provided \nteachers with sufficient room to record those aspects of children’s talk that \nthey viewed as demonstrating really significant steps forward in their learning. \nThese included: \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n178 \n• the increased enthusiasm and confidence that children communicated about \ntheir learning within creative projects  \n• their increased readiness to contribute to group talk  \n• their increased ability to talk at length about their work and to demonstrate \nand discuss the features of their projects  \n• the development of their capacity to evaluate their own work and that of \nothers  \n• the development of their capacity to reflect on what they had learned  \n \nThe ATs for Drama (another statutory strand of the Programme of Study for \nEnglish)  are much less extensive than other Speaking and Listening targets and \ndescribe children working in role, using different modes to convey stories, \nthemes, ideas and emotions, using dramatic techniques and evaluating \nperformances. Although weighted more towards drama as performance than \ndrama as a process for learning and understanding, these ATs could be used \neffectively to evaluate the kinds of processes and performances we observed in \nclassrooms where storytelling, drama, enactment and role play were features \nof children’s learning. \n  \nThe National Curriculum: Foundation Subjects \nSeveral teachers wanted to describe and demonstrate broader improvements in \nchildren’s attainment as a result of creative projects, but none of the off-the-\npeg models immediately available to them seemed to fit the experiences and \noutcomes in classrooms and in children’s learning. Yet assessment criteria in a \nnumber of National Curriculum subjects could have provided teachers with \npossible ways in to the assessment of children’s work in creative projects.  \n \nThe Attainment Targets for Art and Design at Key Stage 2, for instance, \nemphasise the communicative nature of art.   \n \nLevel 1: pupils respond to ideas...communicate ideas and \nmeanings...describe what they think and feel about their and others’ \nwork. \n \nLevel 6: pupils explore and assess visual and other information...they \ndevelop their ideas, taking account of purpose and audience...they \ninterpret to communicate ideas and meanings, and realise their \nintentions...they analyse and comment...they explain how their \nunderstandings of the context affects their views and practice.  \n \nChildren are expected to communicate their ideas and meanings through their \nart work, and to evaluate and reflect on their work.  There are specific links \nmade to the Speaking and Listening Attainment Targets in English. \n \nThe NC ATs for Physical Education reflect some of the work that we observed in \ndance and in drama. The PE programme of study discusses skills and practise. \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n179 \nDance activities are included in Breadth of Study (children should create and \nperform dances using a range of movement patterns, and respond to a range of \nstimuli and accompaniment.) At Key Stage 2: \n \nAT1: Children describe and comment on their own and others’ actions \n \nAT6: They analyse and comment on how skills, techniques and ideas have \nbeen used in their own and in others’ work, and on compositional and \nother aspects of performance, and suggest ways to improve. \n \nIn these examples talk (and, potentially, writing) is used as a medium for \nreflection, analysis and self-evaluation. These Attainment Targets, relating to \nvisual art, craft and design, alongside the aspect of the Speaking and Listening \nattainment target which relates to drama, could have been used to assess \nchildren’s progress in many of the creative projects that made up Animating \nLiteracy. But, perhaps because these projects were seen as separate from the \ncurriculum on offer, teachers did not turn to the ATs in creative subjects when \nconsidering how to assess children’s learning.  \n \nIt is quite possible that teachers were less focused on, and less aware of, these \ncriteria because of the government’s downgrading of the importance of the \n‘foundation subjects’ which took place in the late 1990s in favour of the three \ncore subjects of statutory testing : English, Maths and Science. The primary \ncurriculum in recent years has narrowed children’s opportunities for making \nand crafting and for work in the creative arts in general. In essence, teachers \nwere simply not used to thinking about assessment beyond the SATs. As teacher \nSP in School B said: \n   \n       SATS are the only assessment that matters. \n \nEven had teachers drawn on these Foundation Subject attainment targets, they \nwould have met the problem that these creative projects were one-off projects \nwith a short life, and were not necessarily going to be built on in future. As we \nobserved in Chapter Eight, children would often have liked to have used and \nextended some of the techniques they had learned through creative arts \nprojects in their subsequent curriculum work, but systematic opportunities for \ndoing this were rarely if ever available. The National Curriculum enshrines \nchildren’s entitlement to art, drama, music and dance, and the National \nCurriculum Attainment Targets assume that children’s educational experience \nis going to be a matter of progression within a particular discipline. But in most \nprimary schools, the long-term development in the arts that is envisaged in \nthese attainment targets is not allowed for within the timetable. Children have \naccess to these experiences, but development is rare. \n \nWithout the possibilities of building on previous creative experiences, where, \nwhen and how will the type of talk envisaged in the Art and Design and PE \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n180 \nattainment targets take place? How are children’s skills to be developed so that \nthey may talk about their work with increasing sophistication? When the \nopportunities for crafting, making and doing are limited, so are the \nopportunities for developing the language to talk about creative work and \nproducts. \n \nAlternative frameworks \nIn addition to the NC ATs, some other frameworks do exist for the assessment \nof progress in creative subjects, and for evaluating multi-modal texts. Below \nwe analyse some of the more relevant models that could be helpful to teachers \nembarking on the assessment of multi-modal creative projects. \n \nLook Again! A teaching guide to using film and television with three-to-\neleven-hear olds (2003) The British Film Institute \nThe BFI outlines progression in becoming ‘cineliterate’ and makes links to \nNational Curriculum targets in what BFI calls ‘creative subjects’ (Art and \nDesign, ICT, Music and Drama), ‘investigative subjects’ (Science, History and \nGeography) and ‘moral and personal subjects (PSHE, Citizenship and Religious \nEducation). For the most part however the BFI curriculum is focused on film as \nits own subject and children becoming ‘film literate’ through close analysis of \nmoving image texts. Like the Speaking and Listening AT, the focus of the BFI \nprogression levels sometimes touch on but do not fully take in the broader \ncompetencies that, for example, Teacher K’s class (Class Study Four) \ndeveloped through their study of film.  \n \nDrama in Schools (2003) Arts Council England \nDrama in Schools makes links to ATs and assessment descriptors from National \nCurriculum subjects (Music, Art and Design, English, and PE). It also refers to \ntargets of the National Literacy Strategy, the National Primary Strategy and the \nQCA guidance on Speaking and Listening. In referring to a number of \nassessment frameworks in different subject areas, Drama in Schools in effect \nargues for a holistic approach which recognises many different kinds of learning \ninherent in creative arts work.       \n \nDrama in Schools also takes a specialist approach within a broad framework \nthat acknowledges current curriculum realities. It explicitly shows how a wide \nrange of drama work can be taught and learned within the statutory \nframeworks. This would support teachers in making assessments of work in \ncreative arts projects ‘count’.  \n \nTalk and reflective discussion have a central place. Drama in Schools takes \naccount of the kinds of learning we observed in teacher GD’s class (Class Study \nOne) where children used drama to explore and reflect on the themes of a \nnovel. Teacher GD would have been supported by the way in which Drama in \nSchools makes reading a key feature of learning in its specialist area. The \nframework makes references to literature and poetry. It envisages children \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n181 \ndoing a range of reading and writing as they develop their skills, knowledge and \nunderstanding of drama.  \n \nHowever Drama in Schools is weighted more towards theatre and performance \nthan multi-faceted exploration.  Teacher GD’s class would have covered few of \nthe level descriptors and attainment targets in Performance which are a \nsignificant aspect of the framework’s progression.  \n  \nDrama in Schools - like the National Curriculum foundation subjects – also \nenvisages progression in educational contexts where drama (like art and design, \nmusic or dance) may be one-off experiences. Drama in Schools, like the \nNational Curriculum attainment targets, assumes that children’s educational \nexperience is going to be a matter of progression within a particular discipline.    \n \nMore than words: multimodal texts in the classroom (2004) UKLA/QCA  \nWriting tasks formed the bulk of teacher-led follow-up to arts partners’ weekly \nvisits to classrooms because children’s writing could be evaluated clearly within \ncurrent assessment frameworks. Yet some of the more multimodal texts that \nwere produced as an integral part of these projects were harder to assess in \nthis way. Teachers may therefore find More Than Words useful in beginning to \nthink about to assess multimodal texts.  \nUsing exemplar multimodal texts, More than words shows how the statutory \nassessment criteria for writing may be applied to children’s drawings. It \nincludes other elements besides writing in writing assessment (eg drawings, \ngraphic design). However, because it subsumes these elements into ‘writing’ \nthey cannot be looked at in their own right. \n \nTeachers may find the approach taken in this document risky; they would have \nto make their own evaluative judgements about children’s drawings and about \ngraphic design in children’s writing. For example, in experimenting with the \napplication of the writing attainment target to a young child’s labelled picture, \nthe authors make claims for children’s multimodal texts that may be \nidiosyncratic rather than intentional (eg a child’s ‘smudging’ effect on a \npicture to indicate uncertainty, or a child’s use of white space as visual \n‘punctuation’).  \n \nThe framework is focused on the end product of writing. The language to \ndescribe progress in writing has not been changed; visual elements are simply \nadded ‘ingredients’ to be assessed within the invariable framework.   Teachers \nwould have to work very hard to overlay this framework on the range of \nmultimodal texts such as collaborative films, storyboards, drawings with an oral \nstory and Powerpoint presentations that we presented here.  \n \nMost importantly, because the language of the attainment target is the \nlanguage of summary assessment, there is no attention to the process by which \nchildren might learn these multimodal skills of expression. It seems to be \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n182 \nassumed that children are familiar with such texts through their experiences in \nthe world, and that they bring this background knowledge of multimodal forms \nto producing school texts. Yet our research has shown how important it is for \nteachers to focus on the process by which children learn, through making, to \napply a range of skills to the production of multimodal texts.  \n \nThe Assessment of Performance in Design and Technology (1991) APU  \nOne of the most innovative and exciting ways of assessing progress in creative \nprojects, with due regard to the process of learning as well as to the end \nproduct, is the last report produced by the Assessment of Performance Unit. \nThis remarkably forward-looking document offers a most thorough and \nthoughtful guide to what is involved in making a judgement about pupils’ \nlearning in areas which involve them in both thinking and making.  \n \nThe authors of the report describe why they reject an atomistic model of \nassessment, one which consists of analysing a competence into components and \ntesting these component bits. Of such atomistic approaches to assessment they \nsay: \n'Whilst the analysis of the process into ... discrete elements may have \nhelped teachers to get to grips with the parameters of what is involved \nin tackling a design and technology task, it has frequently emasculated \nit by ripping it apart in quite unnatural and unnecessary ways. \nAssessment in design and technology has too often assumed that you can \nmeasure the quality of an omelette simply by measuring (and \naggregating) the individual quality of the eggs, the milk, the butter and \nthe herbs....’ \n \nThis holistic model of analysis developed in this report made thinking and \ndecision-making as important as making. Among the most thought-provoking \naspects of the report was its account of the ‘interaction of mind and hand’ in \nany design project. The report’s authors recognised that projects that involve \nmaking also involve thinking, but also stressed the constant interplay between \nthinking and making in such projects. \n \n‘ It is through externalised modelling that complex ideas can be \nexpressed and clarified, thus supporting the next stage of cognitive \nmodelling. It is our contention that this inter-relationship between \nmodelling ideas in the mind, and modelling ideas in reality is the \ncornerstone of capability in design and technology. It is best described \nas “thought in action” ‘. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n183 \n \n \n \nThese twin aspects of capability – action and reflection – were apparent too in \nthe projects that we observed. An assessment model which took into account \nthe thinking behind making, and which gave space to children’s capacity to \nreflect on their own learning, would have provided teachers with a rigorous, \nyet open, framework for looking at learning in these creative projects. It would \nhave enabled them to record the development over time of children’s work \nwithin the projects. It would have included children’s texts as contributions to \nan overall project, even when they were not the main outcomes (such as the \npoems that children at MF wrote as part of their work in drama). It would have \nenabled children’s working talk, and their own self-evaluations in talk or \nwriting, to count towards their assessment. It would also have enabled \nteachers, guided by the NC ATs, to apply relevant artistic standards to the \noutcomes of these projects. \n \nThe APU model starts with ‘hazy ideas’ in the head and moves back and forth \nbetween doing, making and thinking. It makes thinking and initial, exploratory \nmodelling an explicit part of the working process. We observed this in action, \nin project classrooms where children made exploratory notes, drawings and \nstoryboards (Class Study Four), exploratory dialogues (Class Study One), \nsketches and models (Class Study Three). Children used these initial, \nexploratory modes to think, talk, and move forward in their work. \n \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n184 \n \nPhases of learning \nAs Somers (2000) observed in his work with children in drama, and as our class \nstudies also demonstrate, in creative arts projects a number of forms of \nlearning are taking place. The most easily observed – and measured - is the \nacquisition of specific skills, but this does not exist in isolation from other \nelements of the experience.  \n \nThe multifaceted learning inherent in creative arts projects is what makes the \nassessment of them so challenging. In the projects observed for this research, \nchildren were learning how to ‘work’ in different creative practices, exploring, \ntalking, creating and reflecting. They were learning skills, techniques and \nrelated vocabulary. They were writing about their experiences and their \nunderstandings in different modes. They were becoming more aware of they \nwere talking and thinking. They inhabited different phases of learning \nthroughout projects as they became more confident and proficient with art \nforms. Somers (ibid.) described phases of learning in drama, which we modify \nonly slightly here to describe phases of learning in the creative arts projects we \nobserved: \n1. Knowledge of the facts, skills and issues that underpin a medium \n \n2. Knowledge of which aspects of what has been discovered have most \nrelevance to children personally \n \n3. Ability to discern which aspects have most relevance for the medium \nitself \n \n4. Ability to capture material effectively in the medium and communicate \nit to others \n \n5. Ability to reflect on the process and product and to build this \nknowledge gained into future work    \n \nPatterns of Learning  \nThese different ‘phases’ of learning might more appropriately be termed \n‘facets’ or ‘strands’. They do not succeed each other so much as interact. For \ninstance, the ability to reflect, as is indicated by the APU Report  and in \nSomers does not come into play only at the end of a creative arts project, but \nis part of its development. The creative arts projects of this research showed \nthat teachers (and children) need a multifaceted model of learning, in which \nthe different strands interact and inform one another. \n \nThe Primary Language Record Learning Continuum (Patterns of Learning, CLPE \n1991) was devised in order to provide just such a broad map of progress and \ndevelopment. Although originally developed in order to describe progress in \nlanguage and literacy, it can also be applied to learning across the curriculum, \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n185 \nand in cross-curricular projects. Because of this it offers an obviously \nappropriate model for assessing creative projects. It consists of five \ninterrelated strands, each of which describes an important aspect of learning. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \nConfidence and Independence  \nThe first strand, confidence and independence, to which we might add \ninvolvement and enjoyment, is concerned with children’s feelings and attitudes \ntowards their learning.  \n \nI used to be shy. I didn’t know how to do stories. I couldn’t read. [Arts \npartner] J came and J taught me how to read, how to write, how to make \nstories. She gave me confidence.  \n(B, Year 2) \n \nArts partner JB did not actually teach reading or writing. But the young girl \nspeaking here became actively engaged in other school work through her \nexperiences in the creative arts project. She became a confident learner. It \nwas evident from our observations that this strand of the continuum was the \none that teachers referred to most frequently when evaluating the gains that \nchildren had made in relation to creative projects. Yet they had no way of \nmaking these important developments count in their formal assessments. \n \nExperience \nThe second strand of the continuum concerns a child’s experience as a learner. \nAs children become more confident, they are able to engage in a broader range \nof experiences and deepen their learning.   \n \nWhen I went to see these plays and talked to the cast and did the lighting \nmyself in the workshop, it made me think properly. The scriptwriter has \nto think about all those things. It changed my writing. I used to write \n‘once upon a time there was a girl’ stories, quite imaginative stories. I \n \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n186 \nthought about it a lot, and the stories that are actually something more \ninteresting are about real life, everyday life.  \n(S, Year 6) \n \nOur observations have made clear that opportunities for extended and \nrepeated experiences in creative arts projects are crucial if children are to \nbenefit from this type of work. \n \nStrategies \nThe third strand of the continuum is concerned with skills and strategies, the \nkinds of practical abilities that experienced learners draw upon in going about \ntheir learning. In reading, they might include drawing on a range of cueing \nsystems to read an unfamiliar word. In art and design projects, strategies might \ninclude relevant craft skills and the appropriate use of materials. Through \nrepeated experiences, children gradually take on a range of strategies and \nlearn to use them appropriately.  \n \nNow I know how to make slip, to glaze and fire in the kiln. Our teacher \nwas a professional. Now I have new ideas for every new thing I do. I don’t \njust rely on my old ideas. \nM, Year 5 (was in Year 4 in the art project) \n \nYou read, you write, you act. You play [drama] games. It makes you \nbetter with having different partners, making new friends in class. (K, \nYear 5) \n \nIn addition to strategies that are specific to particular subjects, children \nacquire general learning strategies which apply more widely, such as the ability \nto work collaboratively, or to generate ideas through brainstorming. We \nobserved children acquiring many valuable strategies in the course of creative \narts projects; a broad model of assessment would have allowed these to be \nrecorded and acknowledged. \n \nKnowledge and understanding \nThis aspect of learning is the one most heavily emphasised in the National \nCurriculum, with its focus on ‘knowledge, skills and understanding’. Children’s \nknowledge and understanding is developed through creative arts projects in \nmany ways, but the kind of knowledge and understanding of the world that was \nvisibly enhanced by the projects we observed is not recognised in any NC \nattainment target. For instance, children in several of the projects went \noutside school to observe and work with adult professionals. They acquired a \nbetter understanding of the kind of practice and discipline involved in \nachieving a professional standard.  \n \n \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n187 \nI learnt all the different shots – long, wide, cherry picker, bird’s eye, \nclose, - how the sound works, how to edit films.  It was fun. I also learnt \nthat using the microphone is hard work, standing and holding it. It takes \na long time to make films. I appreciate people that make long films now. \nWhat sort of things they did to make the shots, how to make the sound \nblend in, how to make it look good. You know how they made it, so that \nmakes it seem better. (B, Year 5) \n \nThis kind of knowledge and understanding was an important part of children’s \nlearning, and affected their own ways of working within the projects. Children \nstrived to emulate the professional personas and practices they observed \noutside of school.  \n \nReflection \nThe final strand of the continuum has to do with the ability to reflect on one’s \nown learning. The habit of reflection is a means of learning that children can \nuse from early on. In order to activate this means of learning, children need to \nbe engaged in reflective conversations and discussions, both in large groups and \nin pairs, with peers and with adults. In reflection, learners consider what they \nknow and what they need to know. The ability to reflect both on what has been \nlearned and on one’s own learning processes were very well developed in some \nof these creative projects.  \n \nI’m not bothered about talking to the group now, about sharing. I realised \nit doesn’t matter if I get it wrong, I might learn something.(N, Year 5) \n \nThese qualities were evident in Teacher GD’s classroom (Class Study One) \nwhere children learned about the themes of a novel by linking it to their own \nexperiences. They were evident in Teacher AH’s classroom (Class Study Two), \nwhere questioning was at the centre of children’s involvement in creative \nprojects and was an important prelude to their writing. They were also strongly \npresent in Teacher KR’s classroom (Class Study Four), where the painful process \nof learning to work together, and to evaluate their own progress, was such a \nstriking feature of the achievement of this class. Again, this is a mode of \nlearning which needs to be more fully acknowledged in any model of \nassessment, and which is greatly encouraged by a focus on children’s self-\nevaluations.  \n \nGaps in assessment and progression \nIn this chapter we have examined different assessment models in the context \nof children’s experiences in creative arts projects. Only teacher assessment \nseemed to fairly reflect the extent of children’s processes, work and thinking. \nThis type of assessment demands observant, sensitive teachers who are able to \ndescribe children in words and not as numbers.  \n \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n188 \nArts partners working in classrooms can be natural assessment partners for \nteachers. In our research, arts partners such as SS, NB, JB and TM frequently \nevaluated the responses and progress of individual children and groups. Their \nassessments influenced teacher perceptions and teacher knowledge of children.  \n \nThere is a particular role for this type of assessment in the Foundation subjects \n(Art and Design, Design Technology, Music, PE, ICT, History and Geography) \nbecause they are only evaluated by the teacher rather than exterior, statutory \ntests. It is clearly valid and valuable in the Core subjects (English, Maths, \nScience) as well.  Yet, as we have shown elsewhere, teacher assessment is \nunder-valued in the current statutory system (Safford, O’Sullivan & Barrs 2004). \nTeachers could look more closely at the language of the Foundation Subjects’ \nattainment targets to evaluate children’s work and progress in creative arts \nprojects.  \n \nWe have also examined the lack of progression and continuity in children’s \ncreative arts experiences. This is connected to issues of evaluation and \nassessment. The reputation of schools and individual teachers stands or falls on \nchildren’s attainment in Core subject tests; teachers are necessarily concerned \nwith children’s continuity and progression in these subjects. But the National \nCurriculum also enshrines entitlement to the arts and the Foundation subjects, \nand therefore schools should also ensure children’s continuity, progression and \nachievement in these curriculum areas. \n  \n \n \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n189 \n \n \n \n            Chapter 10 \n \n   Findings and conclusions  \n \n \n \nI’ve wrote stories before, stories on me, not imagining stuff what I \nwould do and gonna do. This is better, because you’re imagining what \nyou might want to do later on in life. Or you might want to do what you \nare imagining. You’re not writing the story of what you already done. \nYou’re writing the story of what you would like to do. Everyone’s is \ndifferent from each other, cos we all have different imaginations. \n(Jordan, Year 4)  \n \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n190 \n \nResearch findings  \nThroughout this enquiry we have been examining how children, teachers and \narts partners work together in creative projects in classrooms. The projects \nthat have been the subject of our observations had very different starting \npoints, contexts and outcomes. Teachers and arts partners sometimes related \nclosely to each other and had strong common understandings; sometimes, \nhowever, they had conflicting aims, beliefs and roles. In several schools, \nchildren showed themselves to be capable of responding sensitively and \nthoughtfully to work in the creative arts. But what was the influence of all this \nwork on their other learning? Did their successful experiences of creative work, \nas is often suggested, lead to improvements in the rest of their school learning, \nespecially in language and literacy? We returned to our research questions.  \n \nResearch question one \n• How does children’s work in the creative arts influence their language \nand literacy development? Are there underlying patterns across \ncreative arts forms?  \n \nWorld-making \nTwo strands of language are observable when children work in the creative \narts. There is the language that is used in real-world contexts, where children \nare learning and using professional skills, developing professional knowledge \nand a new vocabulary, communicating with arts practitioners, and performing \nor exhibiting in public spaces. And there is the language children draw on as \nthey create imaginary worlds, in artwork, music, movement, enactment, \nstories and writing – all of which world-making is mediated through talk.  \n \nThese two strands come together as children weave imaginary and real-life \nwork and experiences together in creative arts projects. They create art, \ndance, films and stories from explorations and enactments in imagined worlds. \nThey describe, discuss, display or perform their work to audiences. These \nstrands of literacy tap into authentic thoughts and feelings of children as whole \npeople. As arts partner SS said, “Children are not sub-human, they are very \nhuman.”  \n \nWhen children work in the creative arts, they look both inwards and outwards: \ninwards to interior, imagined worlds and outwards to real, but often \nunfamiliar, worlds.  They engage in work that is simultaneously reflective and \nactive, imaginative and practical. The simultaneous inward- and outward- \nlooking, active and contemplative nature of work in the creative arts can be \nseen to mirror the acts of reading and writing. Literacy is a ‘particularly \nefficacious way to make worlds’ (Frank Smith 1984) and is an essential means \nof organising ideas and communicating with others; literacy is a creative \nachievement.  \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n191 \n \nInhabiting symbolic worlds \nIn the Class Studies and in Chapters 6, 7 and 8 we examined many forms of \nworld-making, where children imagine and build worlds in different media and \nin many modes: dance, drawing, crafting, modelling and painting.  \n \nOnce I was drawing the pictures, I started going into a different world \nand making up all different stories myself. Even though I didn’t know the \nstories, I got my ideas together (Tashi, Year 5) \n \nWe were seeing it in our heads, not acting it. We were seeing it in our \nheads...I did see pictures in my head, when I was dancing. I imagined it. \n(Cal, Year 2) \n \nIn my box the yellow bit is a playground. Snake children will play there.  \n(Ruby, age 3) \n \nMy drawing is a mouse, in a bed, I make a bed for my mouse, a telly, \nhe’ll watch telly, some cheese, he’ll be in his bed, a big circle bed, a \ncover, a pillow, that’s the brother mouse. (Shaidon, age 3, drawing) \n \nThe words just come into your head and it gives you a good picture. \n (Max, Year 5) \n \nWe showed how these symbolic worlds can be transformed into worlds built \nthrough words, worlds realised through storytelling, narration, drama and in \nwriting. In Chapter 7, children created ‘storyworlds’ first as drawings, and \nthrough enactment, making and crafting. They used these symbolic modes \nbefore they move into writing. Similarly, the older children in School DP (Class \nStudy Four) created storyworlds in role play and then in storyboards; these \nbecame film scripts and finally films based on their real lives at school. \nChildren in School MF (Class Study One) entered the world of a novel set in \nBangladesh through drama and artwork; they were able to develop unique, \ncontinuously evolving dramatic dialogues and writing.  \n  \nLocating oneself in real worlds \nIn the Class Studies we have also seen how children begin to locate themselves \nin the real world through their experiences in creative arts projects. Children \nlearn from professional artistic practitioners. They observe the way they \napproach their work in rehearsal and in performance. They try out some of \nthese roles. They feel a sense of expertise and responsibility. Through these \nexperiences they sometimes begin to voice their aspirations. They appreciate \nthe hard work and practice that goes into a professional performance. They \nbegin to understand how art is produced. They see that enjoying your work can \nbe life-enhancing.   \n \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n192 \nAll my friends in the class, when they grow up, they want to be on \ncamera. Some of them want to be an actor. Some of us want to be a film \ncrew. I would like to be a director.[arts partner]  NB said I would be a \ngreat director. During the filming…I helped her out. I sorted things out \nand she said I would be a good director. (Jahura, Year 5)    \n \n[When I see my film] I’m a bit excited but then I’m a bit shy and I don’t \nwant people to see it. But if you make a film that’s what you have to do. \nIf you’re a real actor, people have to see your talents. (Kiah, Year 5)     \n \nI would not like to be an artist, but I would just like to be a normal \nperson who can draw anytime. When you do drawings, you can put them \naround your house.  (Dami, Year 6)  \n \nIn creative arts projects, children see real-life expertise and roles and begin to \nunderstand how different roles (e.g. lighting, sound, scripts, storyboards) \ncontribute to a group effort. Children like M. in Year 6 (Class Study 2) can begin \nto imagine their futures, as a ‘sound man’ or in any number of roles. As Artist O \ntold M. and his classmates following an opera workshop and performance: \n \nIn the opera there are hundreds of jobs. Painting sets, \ndesigning, singing, wardrobe. There are jobs for all of you out \nthere. \n \nTeachers observe children responding positively to the real-life, three-\ndimensional, active, social and contemporary forms of literacy in creative arts \nwork. It is work that is purposeful and has an audience in mind. \n \nThe whole project is building towards something...all the watching of \nfilms, all the writing they’re doing, all the drama – it’s all leading towards \na particular goal. (Teacher KR) \n \nThrough work in the creative arts, children understand better the uses of \nliteracy. They show increased awareness of the purposes and audiences of \nliteracy. They also show improved attitudes to school literacy and write with \nmore interest and commitment, because their creative arts experiences give \nthem something to think, talk and write about.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n193 \nResearch question two \n• What are favourable contexts and effective processes for children’s \nlanguage and literacy development in creative arts projects?  \n \nA shared professional vision \nIn Chapter 3 and in the Class Studies we show how the collaborative teacher-\nartist relationship makes creative arts partnerships work effectively. Successful \nprojects do not appear to be dependent on length of time or on school context. \nTeacher GD and arts partner SS (Class Study One) worked together for a single \nterm. Teacher KR and arts partner NB (Class Study Four) worked in isolation \nfrom the school. Yet in both cases the gains for children were marked. These \npartnerships made children’s learning the central focus of the project. The \nClass Studies, that are very different in many ways, nevertheless show how \nsuccessful projects hinge on a shared vision of how children learn and a wide \ninterpretation of what constitutes ‘work’ and literacy.  \n \nWe need to create wider structures for learning, for the kinds of literacy \nthat excite me: debating, understanding, negotiating, listening, \ncommunicating, literacy in the broadest sense of the word. (Arts partner \nGA) \n \nA workshop atmosphere  \nWork in the creative arts can re-define what constitutes ‘work’ in the \nclassroom. The Class Studies reveal effective pedagogy taking place alongside \nmany different art forms: in all these cases the projects had created a \n‘workshop’ atmosphere where everyone was engaged and busy, where teaching \npromoted patterns of concentration, confidence, collaboration and ownership. \nIn the Class Studies of Chapter Four we showed how work in creative arts can \nbe guided by process, by product, or both; work can be an exploration that \nleads to a ‘performance of understanding’.   \n \nChildren deepen their understanding of creative arts practices by returning to \nand expressing themes in a range of different modes. They return to the \ndrawing board, re-think and re-work ideas, moving between modes and media \nin drawings, models, enactments, storyboards, notes, dialogues and drafts. \nThey grow increasingly able to reflect on their learning through these frequent \nopportunities for what the APU (1991) has called as “the interaction of hand \nand mind”. There is time to think and imagine, to go back and forth between \nideas and models. Concepts and images in children’s heads are realised in two \nand three dimensions, and in writing.  \n \nThinking through talking  \nThroughout this research, children’s talk emerges as the cornerstone of their \nthinking in creative arts work.  Their talk is promoted in a wide range of \ncontexts: in drama and role play, in exploratory brainstorming and thinking \ntime, in group work, in collaborative writing, in reflective discussion. \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n194 \nExperiences of work in creative arts lead to more abundant and reflective talk, \nand develop children’s thinking. In Chapter 5 we analyse the wide range of \nchildren’s talk in creative arts work and examine how this talk underpins their \nlearning.  The quality of children’s talk is a significant factor in the \ndevelopment of their thinking and in the quality of the outcomes of creative \nprojects. In Chapter Four we compare children’s language and literacy \ndevelopment in different creative arts projects. Children in Class Studies One, \nTwo and Four were given extensive opportunities to talk through what they \nwere learning throughout the projects. They were able to describe their work \nand their understanding in great depth and detail. Where the energy of \ncreative arts activities was channelled into purposeful talk, we observed the \ngeneral level of talk in the class becoming more explicit and aware. Children \nwere more capable of discussing technical features of their work, and readier \nto share deeper responses. Children in Teacher GD’s drama project (Class Study \nOne), Teacher AH’s theatre arts project (Class Study Two) and Teacher KR’s \nfilmmaking project (Class Study Four) demonstrated an enhanced ability to \ndescribe and reflect on their experiences.  \nChildren value the reflective aspect of talk in the creative arts. Opportunities \nfor talk in creative arts projects call on children, as Danny in Year 6 said, ‘to \nthink MORE’. Children’s own evaluations (I’m talking in my head…I’m seeing it \nin my head…I start going into a different world…’) are evidence that their work \nin the creative arts goes beyond the ‘divergent thinking’ model of creativity \n(QCA 2003) and moves into more reflective, introspective and imaginative \nmodes. Through this talk, children become more aware of their own thought \nprocesses. In Chapter 8 children also express awareness of direct and indirect \nlearning in their creative arts work. Children attribute their improvements in \nreading, writing and speaking, and their feelings of enhanced confidence and \nunderstanding to their experiences in creative arts projects. \n \nThe role of texts \nLiterature, poetry and stories provided cohesive contexts and memorable paths \nto work in the creative arts. In some projects, a focus on literature brought \ntogether reading, writing, making, crafting and bodily enactment in a holistic \nway that also addressed curriculum demands. Powerful texts equally inspired \nthe teacher and the arts partner and generated deep responses from children; \nwork around texts also had the advantage of drawing on the expertise of the \nteacher. Creative arts projects gave children opportunities to explore ‘between \nthe lines’ of books through talk, drama, movement and visual artwork. As \nJoseph in Year 5 (Chapter 7) said, ‘The thing that helps me do art is my \nreading’.  Where children had opportunities to move between the world of the \nstory and physical, symbolic manifestations of the storyworld in art, dance and \nenactment, this process deepened their understanding of both the text and the \nartistic process.  \n \n \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n195 \nResearch question three \n• What is appropriate assessment of children’s work in creative projects? \n \nWays forward in a fragmented curriculum \nWe have shown how creative arts projects can highlight anomalies in the \nprimary curriculum and its related assessment frameworks. The Class Studies of \nChapter 4, and Chapters 5 and 6, show the many different kinds of technical, \nlanguage, literacy and affective learning that take place simultaneously in \nthese projects. Teachers often feel it would be inappropriate to assess \nchildren’s work in an ‘aesthetic limbo’ and tend to evaluate finished products \nin the context of children’s conception, planning, development, problem-\nsolving and reflection. But within these projects teachers struggled to map the \navailable assessment criteria onto their observations and evaluations. \n \nTeachers and arts partners felt that appropriate evaluation ought to be in \nkeeping with the nature of children’s work. Product-orientated work may \ndemand a more straightforwardly criterion-based assessment. Process-\norientated work may require an evaluation that is tentative and exploratory in \ncharacter, taking place at many points during the creative project. Appropriate \nevaluation would also acknowledge and value children’s talk and the role this \nplays in learning.  \n  \nIn Chapter 9 we evaluate models of assessment in the context of creative arts \nprojects. The National Curriculum’s Speaking and Listening and Drama \nattainment targets (both in the Programme of Study for English) offer pathways \nto assessment of children’s work and talk for learning in the creative arts. \nLikewise the attainment targets for the Foundation Subjects (Art and Design, \nDesign and Technology, Music and PE) reflect the kinds of talk and learning that \ntake place. However these assume repeated and progressive exposure to \ncreative arts experiences and a long-term strategy for children’s development \nand learning in creative arts practices.  \n \nAlternative assessment models could potentially support teachers in \nevaluations that would reflect the nature of children’s work. The APU’s \nInteraction of Hand and Mind and the PLR Learning Continuum offer \npossibilities for appropriate assessment of children’ s learning and development \nin these projects.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n196 \nImplications of the research findings: creating the atelier in the literacy \nclassroom \nEffective creative arts projects promote the direct teaching of specialist skills \nand language. Children are then given responsibility to use their new language \nand skills to explore, practise and make something new. Like the African \nmaster tailor who explained to ethnographer Jean Lave (1990, 1991): \n \nWhen I want to teach some one how to make a suit, first I show the   \nwhole suit. I don’t show just one button.  \n \neffective arts partners model and demonstrate the big shape of the work \nbefore children begin making the parts. Children are then allowed to ‘get on \nwith it’ and work independently, while being held to high standards. Children \nsee their own efforts in the context of high-quality products (in film, theatre, \ndance, visual art, drama or storytelling) and in the professional, often \ninspirational persona of the arts partner. In creative arts projects children \ndevelop autonomy and expertise as they aspire to and emulate these practices \nand personas. Children speak of feeling that they are doing ‘proper’ work in \nthese projects.   \n \nThese ways of working in the creative arts can serve as models for work in \nliteracy. In this research we have shown workshop/apprenticeship patterns of \nworking taking place in drama explorations, writing workshops, multimedia \nsessions, filmmaking groups and storytelling projects. Eliot Eisner (2004), like \nDonald Schön (op.cit.), has called for an ‘atelier’ style of working to inform \neducational practice: \n \nIt may be that by shifting the paradigm of education reform and teaching \nfrom one modelled after the clocklike character of the assembly line into \none that is closer to the studio or innovative science laboratory might \nprovide us with a vision that better suits the capacities and the futures of \nthe students we teach. \n \nTeacher AH in his second year of teaching was able to translate the ‘atelier’ of \ncreative arts projects into a ‘writing atelier’ in the classroom. He observed \nthat “Everyone was working at their level. Everyone was writing.”  Teacher GD \nhad been working in this way for many years. \n \nI believe you need to create an atmosphere where children want to learn \nand can learn. Then you have to let them be independent, to play and \npractice what they are doing. As a teacher, you don’t have to be \n‘teaching’ every minute of the time. You have to let them get on with \nit...It has to be relevant. They have to enjoy it. They need time to absorb \nit. (Teacher GD) \n \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n197 \nIn these projects teachers were able to emphasise doing and making, they \nworked and talked alongside children in shared enterprises, and they drew on \nchildren’s interests and aspirations for meaningful literacy learning. But for \nsome teachers this way of working involved considerable risk.  \n \nFor me as a teacher it was amazing to see how children talk to each other \nand to adults about their work, there was a huge amount of talk, building \nup their confidence as linguists and as writers. In objective-led teaching I \nwasn’t noticing a lot of things. It has given me confidence to reflect on \nhow children learn. It has implications for how I adapt the curriculum to \nthe children in my class. I have to be flexible.  But it’s scary. You feel you \nneed things all planned.  \n(Teacher AO) \n \nThe creative arts as a driving force for school reform go beyond recent \npreoccupations with ‘creativity’ in education (see Chapter 7, Being Creative in \nschool). The studio-like settings for arts activities serve as a model for learning \nenvironments more generally: these settings provide children with autonomy \nwithin a creative community. The apprenticeship-like model of learning made \npossible within these settings recalls Jerome Bruner’s ‘mutual leaning \ncommunity’ which ‘provides opportunities for emulation, offers running \ncommentary, provides ‘scaffolding for novices, and even provides a good \ncontext for teaching deliberately’ (Bruner 1993). \n \nBeyond entitlement \nWe have indicated how assessment is affected by issues of continuity and \nprogression in the curriculum as a whole. Our observations suggested that work \nin creative arts projects is rarely planned as part of a continuous \ndevelopmental experience. Teachers were not seen to turn to the Foundation \nSubjects’ Programmes of Study as a context for evaluating these projects and \nthis indicates the current lack of status of these Programmes of Study in \nschools. Children’s progress through the Foundation subjects, and how work in \ncreative projects might contribute to it, was hardly ever discussed.  \nThrough organisations such as Creative Partnerships, it is clear that there has \nbeen an explosion of interest and activity in school-based creative projects. \nThe stated intention of official creativity initiatives is to transform learning in \nclassrooms, but the impact of these projects on the wider arts curriculum is not \nevident from our observations. Although there is currently widespread \ndiscussion of ‘cultural entitlement’ and of the right of all children to have \naccess to experiences like these, there is much less general discussion of \nchildren’s entitlement to a full arts curriculum and how it is to be achieved.   \n \nSchools and teachers may continue to follow narrow definitions of literacy, \n‘work’ and assessment even while they engage enthusiastically in creative arts \nprojects. The double messages now coming from government are experienced \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n198 \nas a double workload by teachers, who must continue to emphasise the Core \nsubjects and focus on preparing children for statutory tests while \nsimultaneously making space for more creative ways of working. What they are \nlearning through these experiences cannot always be put into practice more \nwidely or integrated with their normal curricular planning. Until there is a \nprofound change in the assessment systems, creative projects will continue to \ncreate extra pressures on teachers who already feel that their time is \nrestricted. \nGlimpsing the impossible \nJerome Bruner (1993) was one of many international visitors who made the trip \nto one of the most famous centres of early years education: the small city of \nReggio Emilia in north Italy. The work of the pre-schools of Reggio Emilia has \nbeen recognised around the world. But Bruner confessed afterwards that he \nwasn’t prepared for what he found. This is what he wrote: \n \nWhat struck me about the Reggio pre-schools was how they cultivated \nimagination and in the process, how they empowered the children’s sense \nof what is possible… Imagination is what rescues us from the obvious, \nfrom the ordinariness of life. Imagination turns fact into conjecture. \n \nWhat I saw was not just individual imaginations working separately. We \nwere involved collectively in what is probably the most human thing \nabout human beings – what psychologists call ‘intersubjectivity’:  figuring \nout what others have in mind…. The cultivation of this gift requires a \nclimate of mutual respect and support. It is that kind of respect that is \nthe hallmark of successful schools. \n \nReggio Emilia has often been taken to be paradigmatic of a creative learning \ncommunity. Its schools have, of course, the advantage of being schools for \nyoung children and do not therefore have to temper their creative approaches \nwith strategies designed to raise attainment in tests. Reggio nursery schools, \nlike the early years establishments in Pistoia, Tuscany, are beautiful learning \nenvironments where children are involved in common creative projects, often \nbased on their local environment.  \n \nBoth Bruner and Howard Gardner, another visitor, have drawn attention to the \nsocial nature of the learning in Reggio schools, and the joint nature of these \nchildren’s imaginative projects. Reggio classrooms often look like spacious \nartists’ studios, a great priority is laid by teachers on providing the optimum \nconditions for creative work. The work that goes on in them, as documented in \nThe Hundred Languages of Children (Malaguzzi et.al 1987), merits the NACCCE \n(2001)term ‘applied imagination’, as Bruner’s account suggests.  \n \nIn Reggio Emilia, the relationship of arts practitioners (ateleristas) and \nteachers (pedagogistas) is central to constructing the identities of schools.  \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n199 \nPedagogy and practice are based on an interdisciplinary approach taking into \naccount the different fields of teacher and artist knowledge. Their dialogue \noffers a way to approach and interact with other worlds outside of the school. \nPersonal and professional growth results from reflecting on the children’s work, \nfrom giving visibility to the processes of both children and adults. The \nprofessional encounter between teacher and artist is reflected in the children’s \nwork.  \nChildren are the first to make you shift toward the impossible....this is \nan enormous responsibility carried by the teacher: what instruments, \nequipment, ‘back-packs’, do you have…so that learning is an occasion of \ngrowth for you as well as for the children, and so that the children build \nan awareness of learning and knowing? (Emilia teacher in Malaguzzi \net.al.1987) \n \nOur research has examined this type of encounter in the UK, where work in \ncreative arts enables children to engage in practical and imaginary work, to \nplay, practice and become confident with concepts, techniques and media. An \natelier/workshop model of education creates time and space for children to \npractice and play in literacy and in all curriculum areas.  \n \nChildren need to think about things. They have to play, because play is \npractice. Sometimes you need to practice for a long time. You practice, \nthen you make a conceptual leap. If you look at Picasso’s sketchbooks for \nGuernica, you see him preparing. He has three sketchbooks of horses’ \nheads. They get more and more abstract. I am sure that he was learning \nabout that horse he wanted. By the time he came to paint it on the big \ncanvas, he did not have to think. He had practiced and played with it. As \na teacher you need confidence to let children to that.  (Year 5 teacher \nGD)       \n    \nThere is no quick or simple transition from creative arts to literacy, but the \ncreative arts, because they are fundamental ways of symbolising meaning, \nprovide a powerful context for developing language and literacy. In effective \nprojects, teachers and arts partners have created contexts for learning within \nwhich language and literacy can develop and flourish, alongside other forms of \nsymbolising. Where reading, writing, talk, and the creative arts in classrooms \nenable children to tell their stories, to communicate and make meaning in real \nand imagined worlds, the literacy that emerges is complex and diverse. The \nchallenge is to make this work count more widely. The interest currently being \nshown in ‘creativity’ in education should extend to more creative approaches \ntowards the curriculum and its assessment.   \n \nIn children’s work in the creative arts in classrooms, like the teacher from \nReggio Emilia, we can often see a shift towards ‘the impossible’ in education, \nin which children’s learning is ‘an occasion of growth’ for adults too. In the \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n200 \nmost effective projects we have documented, we have observed the creativity \nof teachers, children and arts partners combining to create experiences within \nwhich all partners have grown, learned and benefited.  \n \n \n \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n201 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAppendices \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n202 \n \nAppendix 1 \nAdvice to artists working with under children under age 5 \n \n• Don’t be afraid of them, they are just slightly anarchic small people \n• Do listen to them they have something to say \n• Don’t rush them, they need time to think \n• Try different ways of asking them questions, they may not answer you because \nthey don’t know what you mean.  When our children were once asked by a poet \n“what is poetry?”, one child, after much consideration, answered “Cheese”!!! \n• Children often take you literally, listen to yourself too.  E.g. you may mean wait \nthere for the moment, when you say “wait there for the present”, but the child \nlistening to you may think they are waiting for an actual present ! \n• Believe in the children’s abilities, don’t make decisions about what they can and \ncan’t do, allow them to experiment with their own creativity. \n• Don’t be too directive, take your lead from the children. \n• Ask teachers for advice and help, we know the children well and have lots of skill \nin supporting them. \n• We do have health and safety issues as well as policies on behaviour and risk \nassessment.  If you have any concerns do ask, but ultimately it is our \nresponsibility to protect you and the children. \n• Not all children are easy, don’t hesitate to ask for help if you need it. \n• We want you the artists for your skill, knowledge and expertise. \n• We want you to teach us, teachers and pupils, new skills. \n• We want you to inspire us. \n• We want your enthusiasm. \n• We want to work with you and we want you to work with us. \n• Be flexible, working with this age can be unexpected and involve some rapid \nrethinks. \n• Mistakes are good, it is the way we all learn. \n• MOST OF ALL enjoy yourselves, relax and have fun, we do and so do the kids.  \n \n \n \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n203 \n \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2005 \n Copyright Centre for Literacy in Primary Education2005 \n \n204 \nAppendix 2                  CLPE Writing Scale 2   Ages 8-12 years                                  © CLPE    \nLevel Description Children in \nOctober 2003 \nChildren in \nJune 2004  \n1  \nInexperienced writer  \n \n(NC Level 1-2c) \nExperience as a writer may be limited: may be composing orally with confidence but be \nreluctant to write or avoid taking risks with transcription.
