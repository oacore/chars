SPIRE. ST5 5BG, STAFFS, UK \n \n \nIt is now often argued that society is steering with the wrong compass. Most decision-making \nprocesses are based on Gross Domestic Product (GDP), favouring economic options that \ngenerate its increase. GDP has long since been used as an indicator of economic performance, \nprogress, and even welfare. Moreover, it is on the basis of GDP that countries are \ninternationally 'ranked'. \nHowever, the increasing salience of environmental issues since the end of the 1960s has led to \ngrowing controversy concerning the interpretation of GDP, in particular regarding a number \nof shortcomings, summarised as follows: \n \n• The traditional System of National Accounts (SNA) focuses on flows only whilst \nignoring stocks (environmental or cultural) and the problems generated by their \ndepreciation. \n• Negative externalities, such as environmental pollution or crime, are not taken into \naccount in the assessment of economic performance and progress. \n• Distribution and inequality issues are not taken into account either. \n• The SNA focuses on production processes that generate monetary exchanges \nsolely; therefore, services that do not involve monetary exchange (e.g. house work) \nare not considered to be contributive to economic welfare. \n \nThe rationale of research in 'green accounting' has been to correct these shortcomings. \nTwo general approaches have been developed. \nThe first aims at constructing an 'adjusted' economic indicator by subtracting or adding what \nis not included in the calculation of GDP. Numerous methods have been developed to \ncalculate a 'sustainable income', an 'aggregate adjusted indicator' or a 'Sustainable Social Net \nNational Product'. They are all based on the idea that environmental resources can be seen as \n'natural capital' since they contribute to the production of goods and services. The strength of \nthe first approach is that the depreciation of natural capital is viewed, as is the case for \nhuman-made capital, as detrimental to wealth and welfare. Hence, it is subtracted from GDP, \nand so are 'Defensive Expenditures', incurred to repair or prevent damages caused by \nenvironmental degradation (to our health, for instance). Perhaps the main weakness of \nviewing the environment as capital, however, is that, embroiled in the economic logic and \njargon, it has lost its intrinsic value and dynamic dimension in the eyes of those who calculate \n'green types of GDP'. Even worse, the calculation of a green GDP is based on the idea that the \nnewly included figures must be expressed in monetary terms in order to be included in the \nequation. Consequently, in this first approach of 'green accounting', research efforts became \ncentered on developing valuation methods to measure the importance of the environment in \nmonetary terms, viewed as the only way of communicating with policy makers. These \nmethods animated much controversy, both from a technical and an ethical perspective and, in \nparallel, some countries' experience of environmental policy-making showed that policy-\nmakers can use information that is not expressed in monetary terms. This resulted in giving \nmore importance to the second type of research, focused on 'satellite accounts' in physical \nrather than monetary terms. \nSatellite accounting has provided new ways of apprehending environmental valuation and \npolicy making. It focuses on describing ecosystem functioning, hence allowing us to identify \nbetter the impact of economic activities on the environment. \nThis is the case for the two most famous and established systems of environmental resource \naccounts: i) the French Natural Patrimony Accounts and ii) the Norwegian Material Flow \naccounts. Satellite accounts can also focus on social information (as is the case in the Social \nAccounting Matrices). They are therefore expressed in physical terms, but linked to the \nstandard SNA in order to show the interactions between the natural and the economic \nsystems. \nThe System of Integrated Economic and Environmental Accounts (SEEA), developed by the \nUnited Nations uses both the physical and monetary approaches and synthesises various \nvaluation methodologies into a flexible framework. At present, it is the only green accounting \nframework that carries any international authority. \nThe debate on green accounting forms part of the broader debate on indicators of \nsustainability, which is currently extremely popular since indicators are viewed as a first step \ntowards realising sustainability. Numerous 'partial' indicators have been developed. Some \nindicator frameworks have also been constructed that are more informative concerning the \ninterdependencies between fundamental environmental, economic and social themes, and that \nreflect the holistic and systemic dimension of sustainability. A growing number of these \nframeworks are being developed into systems of green accounts (e.g. the Dutch National \nAccounting Matrix including Environmental Accounts). The European Commission has also \ndeveloped frameworks of environmental indices to help the decision-making process shift \ntowards policy tools that are more adequate to help in the operationalisation of sustainability. \n",
