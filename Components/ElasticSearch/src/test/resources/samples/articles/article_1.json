Support for virtual learning \ncommunities is also evolving through new initiatives: 24/7 enquiry service and \nreal-time instant messaging; information literacy skills courses; improvements \nin accessibility of services; collaborative library/learning technology \npartnerships; and a just-in-time approach, with a new personalised library \nservice for time-constrained students.     \n \nThe OU is the UK’s largest university with more than 200,000 students. There \nare more than 360 undergraduate and postgraduate courses on offer and \nnearly half of these have a Web presence. This takes the form of a course e-\ndesktop via which the students can access study calendars and schedules, \ncourse readers (PDF-based e-books), study guides and discussion forums \nprovided by the asynchronous FirstClass conferencing system.   \n \nThe increasing pervasiveness of network technologies is giving the OU the \nopportunity to rethink its traditional course production model.  Drivers are \ncompetition from other universities, e-learning and global delivery, the \ngovernment’s life long learning agenda and the demand for transferable skills.  \nPaul Clark, the University’s new ProVice Chancellor for Learning & Teaching, \nspoke at the recent CITE (Centre for Information Technology in Education) \nconference of the need for new course models if the OU is to remain \nsuccessful.   \n \nMore than 150 OU courses are using IT to enhance learning in various ways \nand 14 are currently delivered almost entirely online.   One of the first web-\nbased online courses, T171 ‘You, Your computer and the Net’, became the \nmost popular computing course in the world in its first year of operation (2000) \nwhen 10,000 students enrolled.   The latest course, a pilot under the UK \neUniversities (UKeU) initiative, ‘Learning in the connected economy’, is to be \n 2\nlaunched in February 2003 and co-produced under the Open Cambridge \npartnership.   \n \nUntil recently, however, OU courses have made little use of online learning \nresources.  The challenge for the Library is to ensure that course teams work \nclosely with Library staff in the selection of these resources and make use of \nexisting electronic library resources where appropriate.    \n \nOpening up the Library service \nThe Library was originally established to support on-site staff, but since 1999 \nit has offered services to students.   At least 160,000 students and their tutors \nare now online and the Library’s own student survey1 shows increasing \ndemand for a range of quality electronic library services. \n \nUnlike other academic libraries, the majority of Open University students live \ntoo far from Milton Keynes to make physical use of our services.  As a result, \nthe Open Library website was developed to provide access to a considerable \nonline collection of resources (100 searchable databases, catalogues, 6,000 \nelectronic journals, 500,000 electronic texts, 3,000 quality-assessed websites \nfor teaching and learning). It provides added value in terms of aggregating \nonline content according to course requirements, improving student access \nand navigability.   \n \nExpanding the role of  the Library \nWith the increasing development of an online collection, the Library is now in \na position to provide remote student access to resources as an integral part of \nonline course delivery, and at no incremental cost to the OU.  A study was \nundertaken recently to understand both the value and cost of the provision of \ncourse support resources. Rightscom2, strategic consultants for digital \ncontent, carried out the investigation.  The issues were explored through \nworkshops and interviews, and an extended attitudinal questionnaire was sent \nto more than 400 OU academic staff.    \n \n 3\nThe findings showed staff recognised the potential advantages to students \nthrough access to a broader range of resources, easy replacement of \noutdated resources, and effective use of feedback mechanisms.  There was \nalso a clear sense that course teams and academics should encourage \nstudents to make more (and better) use of the Library, and that the Library \nhas a role in providing students with guided access to resources, something \nwhich had not been possible until the creation of Open Library.  Furthermore, \nthere was strong support for all OU students to be offered information literacy \nskills courses at least as an option.  Improved coordination between the \nLibrary collection and the content of course support materials was proposed \nand it is hoped that this will lead to better procedures and technical \ninfrastructure for access to online course support material.   \n \nAbout 80% of OU students are in full time employment while studying, so time \nis critical.  Several new library initiatives exploiting new technologies are \nunderway to provide enhanced,  just-in-time support for the students.   \n \nPersonalised library service \nThe MyOpenLibrary project3 aims to develop a personalised library service for \nindividual library users and groups.  Such a system will provide a portable \nlibrary web page identifying the user and aggregating relevant resources for \nfocused study and research.    They will also be able to create their own \npersonal links.  The benefits are that it will save the users’ time and they will \nbe less likely to succumb to information overload.   \n \nThe first stage is to implement a pilot menu-based system, based on the \nMyLibrary software developed at North Carolina State University and hosted \nat Notre Dame University4.  This 18-month pilot will provide evidence of \nefficiency, scalability and cost-effectiveness in six different learning settings in \ntwo faculties (Health & Social Welfare, Arts).  Funding for the project came \nfrom the OU’s eUniversity system, which is supporting a number of initiatives \nto bring about organisational change and e-learning developments.   \n \n 4\nIt is equally important that our users have a seamless view of the University  \nand should not have to cope with multiple “mypages”.  The OU is therefore \nembarking on an institutional portal project, which will offer channels of \ninformation for individuals and user groups – including study calendars, \nschedules, learning environment, student services, links to online library \nresources, administration etc.  This will provide scope for broader integration \nof personalised library services across the University - as the portal becomes \nthe primary access point for all library users.  \nLibrary/Learning technology partnerships \nRe-use of existing course materials is a valuable way of reducing the costs for \nnew courses.   Digitisation and proper archiving of text, audiovisual and \nsoftware material will make re-use feasible. The Digital Video Applications \n(DIVA) initiative, a collaborative venture between the Library, technical course \nproduction staff and media experts, will investigate the use and potential of a \nnetworked digital video archive in this complex university environment. The \nmain users of the system are expected to be course staff, who will benefit \nfrom being able to carry out comprehensive searches on video material to \nlocate clips. Long term it could be a valuable resource for students.   The \nevaluation will be completed in the Autumn 2004. \nAnother library/learning technology partnership project aims to facilitate the \nintegration and embedding of e-resources into the e-curriculum.  The Library \nand media experts in the Institute of Educational Technology (IET) are \nparticipating in DEVIL (Dynamically Enhancing VLE Information in the \nLibrary)5.  This project is led by the University of Edinburgh and funded under \nthe JISC’s Linking Digital Libraries with Virtual Learning Environments \nprogramme.  The Library is working on the resource discovery requirements, \nwhile IET is carrying out the evaluation for identified courses, and of the \nfunctionality and performance of the “middleware” systems layer developed by \nANGEL (Authenticated Networked Guided Environment for Learning)6.  \nPiloting will focus on evaluating the system for pedagogic impact and usability.  \nDEVIL runs until 31st July 2003.  \n 5\nAccessibility of electronic library services  \nMany of the e-resources are proprietary and therefore require authenticated \naccess by the students.  This can be done through the University’s own \nauthentication system (SAMS) or by HE’s Athens system.  With SAMS \nstudents enter their network username and password, and are then directed \nvia a proxy server to many of the e-resources, without the need for further \ndetails.  However, for some resources, remote access passwords are \nrequired, and this is managed using the Athens7 authentication system where \npossible, and with individual passwords where not.  Students are \nautomatically registered for library passwords on course registration, at which \npoint they sign the necessary copyright agreements. They then obtain the \nlibrary passwords by using their student homepage. This means that all \nstudents have the opportunity to access the full range of electronic resources \nthat the OU provides.   \n \nMost of the resource licences are negotiated through CHEST and JISC, but it \nis sometimes necessary for the Library to develop unique arrangements with \ne-journal and database suppliers, as the OU is the only UK university for \nwhich remote access is the predominant method of access. In addition, we \naim to clear resources for access by all 200,000 students as well as academic \nstaff, a significantly larger number of users than other institutions, although in \npractice much smaller numbers will actually make use of the resources.   \n \nTo ensure that the Open Library service is \"open\" to all students, the Library \ninitiated an accessibility study, which identified the needs of students with \ndisabilities and made recommendations for the future development of the \nservice.   The website has been redesigned to ensure it meets accessibility \ncriteria. \n \nThe Library’s information literacy skills course  was launched in May 2002.  \nMOSAIC (Making Sense of Information in the Connected Age), developed in \npartnership with the Faculty of Education and Language Studies, is an online \ncourse for identifying, searching for and critically evaluating information \n 6\nsources.   Numbers on the second presentation of this course in October 2002 \ndoubled to 400 students.   \n \n24/7 enquiry service  \nThe key characteristic of distance learners is that study time occurs in the \nevenings and at weekends.  An analysis of email enquiries and online \nconferencing contributions in 1999 found that 50 per cent were made out of \nhours. The Library is developing an automated enquiry service to provide \nconstant, low-cost effective support.  An early prototype system was \ndeveloped and provided a useful test bed for student feedback.  The current \nphase is focusing on the implementation of a natural language question-\nanswer service, based on the Inktomi search engine.  The approach is to \nmatch the keywords in the question with metadata in the Open Library web \npages to find the right page or resource.  Inktomi will log what queries users \nare submitting, so it is possible to analyse patterns of user questions. \n \nFrom  March to May 2002, the Library ran an experiment with a real-time \ninstant messaging enquiry service, called “Librarians On Call”8, where the \nstudent could chat online to a librarian while being guided to the resource they \nneeded.  The LivePerson Corporate software was purchased for the \nexperiment and the service was staffed during office hours.  In total, 304 \npeople used the service, with 172 engaging in live chats (around 14.3 live \nchats per week), with the remaining 132 sending out-of-hours emails via \nLivePerson while the service was offline.  With the software’s in-built exit \nsurvey functionality, it was possible to gather user feedback to set questions.  \nOf those completing the exit survey, 97 per cent said they would use the \nservice again, with 88 per cent saying they found the service better than \nemail, and 67 per cent better than the telephone.    In October 2002, \nLibrarians on Call was launched as an operational service \n \nConclusion \nThe move towards electronic resources by the Library service will enable OU \nstudents at last to have access to learning resources and services on a par \nwith their peers in other universities. \n 7\n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n1 Bremner, A (2001).
