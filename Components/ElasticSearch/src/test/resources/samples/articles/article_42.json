More specifically, this paper arises from the experiences of the application of \nsystemic approaches to workforce re-modelling following the establishment of the \nnew role of Associate Director Workforce Development (ADWD) (Health and Social \nCare Integration) for the Shropshire and Staffordshire Workforce Development \nConfederation. The post was funded by the NHS but the host employer was one of the \nfour Local Authority Social Services Departments within the boundaries of the \nShropshire and Staffordshire Strategic Health Authority. The paper sets out \npractitioner and client notes on the selection and use of systemic methods applied to \nassist care professionals meet their evolving needs to manage complexity in their \nworking environment. In this paper the reflections of the commissioning client and \nthe main consultant/ researcher are included, both in order to provide an accurate \naccount of the training/ induction process for systems methods, and also as a means to \nprovide the reader with a sense of the practical issues which arise from such \nsituations.  \n \nThe care workforce is in a climate of continuous change, invoking wide scale \nrethinking on almost all aspects of its use and development (for a comprehensive \ndiscussion of key issues see: Davies 2003). The NHS workforce for the Staffordshire \nand Shropshire area (the focus of this paper) is 35,000 and the social care workforce is \nestimated to be nearly as great but largely employed outside the Social Services \nDepartments. Rather, it is supplied by hundreds of different private and charitable \nbusiness employers (these organisations face their own, related challenges, see: \nHarris, Cairns et al. 2004). The ADWD post was expected to work at the interface \nbetween the NHS and the social care sector on workforce development issues. \n \nShropshire and Staffordshire Workforce Development Confederation was established \nin April 2001 to take forward local strategies in support of the national plan for \nmodernisation of the health and social care workforce. Its formation was part of the \nNHS restructuring of Regional Authorities which devolved budgets and \ncommissioning power to these confederations across the country. In 2004 the \n 3\nWorkforce Development Confederations in England were integrated into each of the \n28 Strategic Health Authorities adding another dimension to the latter’s performance \nmanagement role which had been constantly expanding since they had been brought \ninto being in 2002.  \n \nIn the Shropshire and Staffordshire area this meant that the Confederation was now to \nbecome the Workforce Development Directorate (or WDD) of the Shropshire and \nStaffordshire Strategic Health Authority alongside Directorates for Service \nImprovement, Health Strategy, and Performance and Finance. The WDD was tasked \nwith ensuring the local implementation of national policy. Further, and developing \nfrom this role, there is an expectation that the WDD is also performance managing \nHuman Resource (HR) improvement aspects of the work of the Health Trusts in line \nwith Department of Health (DoH) requirements. This is alongside the continuing \nmulti-million pound commissioning role for university provision of health \nprofessional programmes and funding of secondment to these.  \nProblem issues abound for the WDD to manage. Problems of data shortage on vital \nteams within the NHS are well documented (see, for example: Stubbings and Scott \n200; Editorial 2004), the development of decentralised teams working at local level \nseems patchy at best (Deeming 2004), and leadership training and effectiveness \nremains critical (e.g. see: Hewison and Griffiths 2004; Kristina 2004), yet the goal of \nflexible workforces, responding to need flexible and autonomous ways remains the \nphilosophers stone (For a wider discussion on this see: Huselid, Becker et al. 2005) \n \nIn the case of Staffordshire and Shropshire, the WDD had a specific need in the \ndevelopment of capacity in the use of a range of management techniques. The \nadvertisement for the post of ADWD implies as much:  \n“you will play a key role in modernising service delivery through the effective \nintegration of social care and health workforce development strategies, initiatives and \nprocesses. The task is both enormous and multi-faceted. What we’re working to \nachieve is not only an understanding of functional processes and the skills \ndemonstrated by the current workforce to deliver services, but a specification of the \nskill sets required to deliver evolving, emerging and future service models.” \n(Guardian newspaper, June 2001) \n 4\nThe need for the application of systemic processes and methods in the further \ndevelopment of the WDD remit was also clear:  \n“In describing you as the Social Care guru in the WDC, we need to make one point \nabsolutely clear: this is not the time or place for professional advocacy. The whole \npoint is to get away from old pitfalls  - demarcation, adversarial budgeting, territorial \nthinking – and build on the essential elements in the make up of multi-skilled teams” \nThis systemic quality is further emphasised in following sections, including:  \n \n“To take forward the integration of modernisation of the Health and Social Care \nworkforce through the development of integrated workforce planning and \ndevelopment between the NHS and Social Care; scoping the potential for reducing \ndemarcation, changing working practices and roles and initiating projects to produce \nchange; initiating joint reforms in health and social care education and development at \npre and post qualification levels.”   \n(Guardian newspaper, June 2001) \n \nFollowing her appointment, the remit for multi-skilled teams initiating projects, \navoiding old demarcations and adversarial/ territorial thinking was recognised by Ann \nas demonstrating an implicit need for systemic processes. Such processes impose \nresponsibilities and rigours on the organisation. As Charlotte Roberts and Jennifer \nKemeny have argued:  \n\"You can't redesign your system .. by dividing it into parts; everyone must look at the \nwhole together. Thus you can't practice systems thinking as an individual - not \nbecause the discipline itself is difficult, but because good results in a complex system \ndepend on bringing in as many perspectives as possible. As you put together a team, \nmake sure all necessary functions are represented, and gain clearance from top \nmanagement to propose cross-functional solutions, regardless of sensitivities and \npolitics\" \n(Senge, Ross et al. 1994 pages 91 - 92)  \n \n 5\n \nFigure 1. Members of the WDD using Soft Systems Methodology \n \nApproaching the Systemic Intervention \nOn appointment, Ann reflected on the progress being made towards team building \ngoals. In an early reflective email to a colleague she said:  \n“It is vital to have vision and big picture thinking ability; promoting a whole systems \napproach while breaking down the steps to change into something manageable and \nnot too threatening.” \n(Private email from ADWD to a colleague in the WDD) \n \nIn a separate email Ann developed her thinking as follows: \n\"I said that I thought my workplan would mean being a programme manager for a \nrange of projects where I would bring stakeholders together and be a catalyst for them \nto achieve something that they were wanting to do but didn’t know how. Two years \nlater that is exactly what I have been doing.\" \n(Private email from ADWD to a colleague in the WDD) \n \nIn order to provide such a catalyst, Ann approached Simon, to develop a structured, \nsystemic intervention in the form of training need support and private mentoring. At \nthis time the needs of the WDD were clearly stated to be focused on six key items in \nthe terms of engagement: \n 6\n1. A series of training events on systemic approaches to project scoping, planning and \nmanagement.  \n2. Actual project work to be used as the basis for all training \n3. A Team based approach to be applied to all training \n4. The workshop process to be completed 1st October 2003. \n5. That there be a tailored half day for the Executive team. \n6. That on-going support via email be provided. \n \nThe nature of the approach to be adopted had been agreed to be systemic, \nparticipatory methods. Ann had gained some first hand experience of systemic/ \nparticipative approaches at a range of workshops run in London and Rugby and was \nconvinced that they could meet the needs of Professionals in Staffordshire and \nShropshire. In her own words:  \n\"To be able to advise on the scope for integrated workforce planning and development \nand the methods by which that may be achieved could itself only be achieved through \nwide consultation with stakeholders. Harvesting these stakeholders’ ideas whilst \ngaining an understanding of their opinions, their perspectives and their assumptions \nwould be an important task en route\". \n \nThe main requirement from the WDD was to provide Health and Care Professionals \nwith transferable skills to aid in the planning, management and development of \nprojects across the region. It was judged that systemic methods, focused on problem \nsolving, would be most likely to meet this need. Again, in Ann's words: \n\"To be able to advise on reforms in working practices and on new roles which may be \nachievable and provide up to date intelligence on key workforce issues in health and \nsocial care I would need to create the kind of mini-environments that would enable \nme to qualitatively research through using “participative inquiry” and health and care \npathway and process analysis a shared understanding with those involved across \ndiffering cultures of the current working practices and roles being applied by the NHS \nand Social Care organisations\" \n \nIt had further been agreed between Ann and Simon that all training involve real \nprojects in the pipeline. This would help to concentrate participants minds and \n 7\nprovide an acid test for the methods - they would need to be seen to be delivering real \nresults during the learning process.  \nTeams were engaged in the work. Again this was intended to allow cooperating \ncolleagues to learn common methods and provide strength in depth to on-going use of \nthe methods. No one person should be seen as being the team 'expert', all should \ncontribute and participate. Ann notes on this point: \n\"The notion of “releasing” ideas about the transformations needed and the way to \nachieve them to bring about the required modernisation from different people in all \nparts of the affected workforce has been very motivating\". \n \nThe original completion date was September 2003. This was subsequently shifted to \nOctober and then later to early 2004.  \nThe executive team would also be introduced to the method. This was a crucial plus \nfor the research as it meant that the WDD would gain understanding of the methods \nacross the organisational hierarchy. This is rare in the experience of the authors and \nthe lack of such senior buy-in often means that initiatives lack senior champions later \nin the process.  \nFinally, it was agreed that the process would be supported by email and phone support \nduring the project run-time. This would mean that professionals working on specific, \ncomplex issues could have access to support in the development of their proposals.  \n \nMethodologies applied \nThe Systems Department at the Open University has been teaching and researching \nwith systemic approaches for over three decades. Although approaches have changed \nand developed over time, one main methodology, applied across undergraduate and \npostgraduate teaching, has been Soft Systems Methodology or SSM. This approach - \nfirst advocated and subsequently developed by Checkland et al (Checkland 1981; \nCheckland and Scholes 1990; Checkland 1994; Checkland 2001) has been included in \nOpen University courses and developed into a distance learning format (Open \nUniversity 1987; Open University 2000). There has been much discussion about the \nuse of SSM (Stowell, Holland et al. 1990; Haynes 1995; Jayaratna 1997; Probert \n1998; Flood 2001; Holwell 2001) and it has been applied in a wide variety of contexts \n 8\n- most recently the main author's have turned to the complex field of information \nsystems (Checkland and Holwell 1998).  \nSSM has a range of strengths to advocate its use in the development of project \nplanning and can be seen as an aid to other systemic approaches in encouraging \nimaginative problem solving (see for example: Brookfield 1991; Issacs 1999; Wenger \n1999). From the perspective of the present authors these can be listed as: \n1. a capacity to make use of SSM at a very basic level very quickly - it can be \nadopted rapidly \n2. SSM can be applied in such a way as to provide three outcomes essential for a \nproject: a rich picture of what is, a root definition of what could be and an \nactivity plan or conceptual model of how to get there.  \n3. SSM is best used in a participatory manner by mixed teams of stakeholders.  \n4. SSM is a problem solving approach, it is designed to focus on the kinds of \nsoft, intangible problems which beset organisations like the UK NHS \n5. SSM links well as the front end to more formal methods. This allows user \ngroups to begin their planning with SSM and then move on to more formal \ntechniques.  \nAll of these factors keyed in well with the requirements of the WDD as set out in the \nterms of engagement - most specifically for project scoping and early planning.  \n \nIn further developing the project plan, and taking it up to implementation, monitoring \nand evaluation, the Logical Framework Approach or LFA has been applied in a \nvariety of contexts (Coleman 1987; Bell 1998; Baccarini 1999; Kumar and Corbridge \n2002; Biggs and Smith 2003; Crawford 2003; Crawford 2003; Dale 2003) and, as \nwith SSM, has found its way into Open University Systems teaching (Open \nUniversity 1997; Open University 2000; Open University 2004). LFA involves the \ndevelopment of a four by four matrix, containing the main story or the project (the \nnarrative summary), the main assumptions or risks (a key item - often noted as being \nabsent or under-represented in project planning (British Computer Society and Royal \nAcademy of Engineering 2004)) and the means of measuring success in terms of \nperformance, impact, sustainability and strategy – see Table 1. The LFA can provide a \nsystemic, if highly structured, means to capture the outcomes of SSM.  \n \n \n 9\nTable 1. The Logical Framework \nNarrative summary \ncolumn \n \nThe Goal of the \npurposeful human \nactivity.

Although it is not without numerous critics - and it can \ncertainly be applied in a non-participatory and top-down manner (Gasper 1997; \nGasper 2000), it remains a commonly used method in many difficult and complex \ncontexts. Key to the virtues of LFA are: \n1. It can be applied in context and rapidly \n2. It lends itself to participatory workshops \n3. It can be revised readily \n4. it does not require software or IT solutions. \n 10\n5. it links in to other, even more formal project planning methods if necessary.  \nAgain, these five factors all have resonances with the needs of the Directorate. \n \nResearch Question, Workshops outcomes and participant reflections \nIn May 2003 Ann took a proposal in the form of a discussion paper to the WDD \nExecutive team meeting. They had already approved an experimental day with some \nmembers of the team and Simon Bell to explore the possibilities of the methodologies \nhe could introduce. A key question was, could systemic tools and techniques \neffectively develop the various work streams of the WDD? \n  \nA recently completed review of the Confederation’s Organisational Structure and \nProcesses had recommended that it needed to build up its project management \napproach. Ann's paper proposed adopting the use of the Logical Framework model for \nproject planning and agreeing other suitable systems for scoping, monitoring, \nreviewing and reporting on all of the project based work being undertaken.  \nOn Ann's agenda was the plan to help facilitate these developments for the work \nwhich other members of the Confederation team were responsible for while at the \nsame time helping to ensure that social care and health interface issues were \nprioritised for urgent development using these methods.  \nSo, at the instigation of the WDD, a training package for project planning and \ndevelopment was put together which was based upon user-focused variations of SSM \nand LFA. Over a period of eleven months - from April 2003 - May 2004 more than a \ndozen training events took place.  \nMost of the events were either focused on SSM or LFA or, if time allowed - made use \nof both. The user need was paramount and if certain teams needed help with scoping \ntheir specific project, as opposed to planning the detail, then elements of SSM would \nbe applied. It was also notable that, as time progressed, teams began making use of \nkey elements of either methodology, out of sequence, if they thought it would be \nvaluable to them.  \n  \nFollowing the workshops a random sample of Participants was asked to comment on \nthe value of the various aspects applied. Concerning the overall use of SSM: \n \n 11\nWayne Coombe, Head of Human Resources, Staffordshire Social Care and Health \nmade the following observations:  \n\"My experience of Logframe/Soft Systems to date has been very positive …I have \nfound it a useful (yet ultimately simple) technique for pulling together groups of \nindividuals from different organisations (or sub sections of the same organisation). I \nfind that it helps groups who sometimes have significantly contradicting or differing \nviews to reach a consensus on a way forward, yet without any one group or any \nindividual dominating and imposing their own objectives and the experience of \nothers.\" \n \n \nFigure 2. A rich picture of the workforce planning scenario \n \nColin Harriden, a Social Care Workforce Planner, speaking about a workshop for \nRaising the profile of Workforce Planning in Social Care said that systemic methods:  \n\"Enabled a group of senior HR managers in Social Services to work against their \nrelative disempowerment and devise a strategy to promote HR and workforce \nplanning at all levels. The first planned outcome is an event for directorate/CEO level \nto get workforce planning on the agenda and identify champions.\" \nWhen Colin was involved in the use of soft systems with another team he observed: \n 12\n\"The soft systems model enabled a large and diverse group of managers to collaborate  \nin developing common themes and purpose.\" \n \nColin also made use of Logical Frameworks. He says: \n\"Log frame created focused energy - identifying key players assumptions and barriers \nto be addressed. Statement seemed broad but led to specific focus.\" \n \nBut when working with another team with LFA he observed the problem of handing \non previous work to a new group: He noted: \n\"Learning disability workforce strategy - difficult to use an existing log-frame with a \nnew group. . participants need to own the development of the purpose and other \nelements. Side-step to key tasks and barriers helped to re-engage. \nGenerally - the longer you have the more focus and progress towards achievement.\" \n \n \nFigure 3. Developing a rich picture  \n \n 13\n \nFigure 4. An early root definition for training strategy \nPositive comments came from most participants, but critical issues remained. For \nexample, Fiona Shield, Changing Working Practice Coordinator noted some good \noutcomes from her work \n \n\"I have persevered with the logframe and found it useful. \n …. we ended up with 3 versions - 1 per health economy. Although the groups were \nsmall each logframe had its own 'flavour', which we felt was very important in terms \nof reflecting local ownership and culture. When I informed the SHA Trust Directors \nof Modernisation about this work they asked if I could produce one framework for the \nwhole patch. I did this by informal thematic analysis … and kept it to the Purpose and \nOutputs with indicators (attached).\" \nHowever, Fiona had some pithy comments about the use of systemic methods - most \nspecifically Logical Framework in her case:  \n\"I keep asking the Trust CWP leads if they are happy with the Logframe and can't \nhonestly say that they really understand or utilise it. BUT I find it a very useful \nworking tool to refer back to periodically. I think the main problem is that it quickly \nbecomes out of date in terms of the specific outputs and indicators. I could keep \n 14\nupdating it, but then it would lose the ownership of the wider team. However the 1 \nside of A4 attached is quite an impressive document to cirulate when people ask what \nI do and what CWP is about!! We also use it within the team of CWP facilitators to \nhelp check the direction of current work.\" \nMore recently, Fiona has added that, the outcome she was looking for was for the \nwork of the role re-designers to become embedded within the work of the Trusts. But \nhow to evaluate if this has been happening and if so if it was the work of her team that \nhas made it happen? What she can prove is that she had measures in place as part of \nthe project plan. The Logframe was the work plan and seemed to provide a very good \nframework to measure themselves against. Revisiting the Logframe as an evaluation \nexercise and using it as a review tool has given a recent added value for Fiona and her \nteam for all the work that went into producing it. They can see where they’ve come \nfrom. As she says:  \n“We can step back and say: we had something to do and we got on with it”. \n \n \n \nFigure 5. Tasks and issues arising from a rich picture exercise \n \n 15\nLynne Lewis, NVQ/Learning Account Manager applied Logical Framework approach \nto her project: Moving Forward Together For People With Learning Disability \nLynne comments on the process as follows:  \n\"I have used the process of Logical Frameworks for a project to assist with the Skills \nEscalator approach within Learning Disabilities. The process of logical framework \nhas assisted with a systematic approach to achieving a goal. It breaks down tasks into \nbite sized processes, with clear progression to the ultimate goal. The difference from \nmy own personal point of view with this process compared to the average action plan, \nis the thought process behind the bite sized processes. Thought of what could happen, \nand what effect this has on the overall process. An ordinary action plan will inform \nwho does what by when, but does not inform of the contingency plans. My own style \nof learning was assisted by having the dedicated tutor working through the logical \nframework step by step, with a dedicated group, for a common goal. I found a \nprevious session of logical frameworks with a very large group less effective. \n \n \nFigure 6. An activity plan \n \n 16\nJane Rook, (Podiatry Continuous Professional Development), who was lead for the \nWDD and was project managing the development of an agreed system in Shropshire \nand Staffordshire for re-registration of Podiatrists with the Health Professional \nCouncil observed: \n\"There is something about having the actual flip chart paper to work from and \n the post it notes that makes the log frame real and living. I have preferred to have \nthese big and creative bits of paper on the wall to work from and the rich picture to \nwork from in terms of further working out how to tackle the unsaid issues. \nWe are almost at the end of the project and the log frame was a timely reminder as we \nwent along of how to plan to achieve specific targets and to keep me on target. \nVery encouraging to tick off the boxes as I went along . \nI did write the document up properly but have used this version only to send out to \nprove that I do have a project plan to work to. I think it was a definite focus for the \nsteering group to work to as well They have appreciated that the wider Authority \nworks to this planning process and felt more corporate as a result. \nAll in all it was probably a lot easier than some of the project plans based on \nMicrosoft and Prince systems. Probably appealed to my need for visual clues for my \nlearning style\" \nIn private communication Jane has indicated that she would have liked to have used \nthe methodology with the Steering Group right at the beginning of her planning \nprocess but even half way through it was worth doing and proved valuable. Two \nmajor benefits included:  \n• it enabled the mixed range of different kinds of managers with a diverse \nunderstanding of project management (Prinz, Microsoft etc.) to share one \napproach and secondly  \n• it enabled really meaningful conversations with all voices being valued as to \nwhat the project was about and whether or not everyone shared the same \nvision. . \n \n 17\n \nFigure 7. A Logical Framework under development \n \nAnn, as commissioning officer for the workshops observed:  \n\"The dimension that has emerged as so powerful for me in this research is the quality \nof the learning that has been going on in the workshops as groups of colleagues \ndiscussed the elements of their project in order to agree the plan.\"  \n \nAuthor Reflections and Conclusions  \nAs already stated, the authors are not making definitive claims for the WDD \nexperience but, recalling our initial research question: \"could systemic tools and \ntechniques effectively develop the various work streams of the WDD?\", from the \ncomments of participants, and the experiences of the authors some modest claims, \nseeking further testing, can be suggested: \n1. The use of systemic and participatory techniques was greeted by most of those \non the workshops as a relief and a change from their previous experiences of \nsuch events.  \n 18\n2. SSM provided teams with the basis to think widely and divergently about their \nwork context and gave them the 'slack' to think differently \n3. Most of those involved in teams which they worked with regularly, found the \nexperience helpful to the deeper understanding of the tasks which they had \nbeen allocated. \n4. Those who worked in unfamiliar teams found the brainstorming and sharing \ninvolved helpful in their wider understanding of the work of the SSWDD \n5. LFA was seen as being a readily applicable tool for project planning.  \n \nIf these are the positive reflections, some more negative outcomes were: \n1. Small teams seemed to get more from the process than large \n2. The work of one team was not readily understandable or usable to another \n3. The sustainability of the process is a key point. Without renewal and \ncontinued investment in support - some of the good outcomes of the process \ncould dilute over time.  \n \nIn summary, it appears to the authors that some important foundations have been built \nfor essential collaboration to deliver workforce solutions to the challenging task of \ntrying to achieve integrated services in the Staffordshire and Shropshire areas. Most \ncritically, an awareness of the importance of a methodical approach to planning major \nnew initiatives has been raised. \n \n 19\n \nReferences \nBaccarini, D.

This brief paper sets out the main reasons for the application of systemic approaches, the nature of the methodologies put in place and some of the outcomes and reflections of those involved in the various workshops. Whilst not attempting to be definitive in our conclusions, the authors believe that the results of the application of systemic methods by Health and Care professionals show a range of strengths going forward.</dc:description><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>http://oro.open.ac.uk/108/1/SSWDD_v10.pdf</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:source>1094-429X</dc:source><dc:title>Applying Systemic Project Management Approaches for the UK National Health Service</dc:title><rioxxterms:author>Bell, Simon</rioxxterms:author><rioxxterms:author>Christina, Ann</rioxxterms:author><rioxxterms:publication_date>2006-02</rioxxterms:publication_date><rioxxterms:type>Journal Article/Review</rioxxterms:type><rioxxterms:version>NA</rioxxterms:version><rioxxterms:version_of_record>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11213-005-9002-4</rioxxterms:version_of_record></rioxx></metadata></record>",
